# on-post-verify-task.sh — PostToolUse hook for chorus_admin_verify_task
#
# Three independent reminder branches share the post-verify trigger:
#
#   Branch A — OpenSpec archive trigger (legacy)
#     Detects "last task verified for an OpenSpec-mode proposal" and tells
#     the agent to run `openspec archive <slug>` plus mirror updated specs
#     back into Chorus Documents.
#     Gates (all must hold): CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_ENABLEOPENSPEC=true,
#     CHORUS_OPENSPEC_MODE!=off, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/openspec/ exists,
#     `openspec` CLI on PATH, proposal description matches
#     ^OpenSpec change slug:, every task under that proposal is done.
#
#   Branch C — Code-review gateway reminder
#     Tells the agent to spawn the code-reviewer for the idea — the final
#     ship-time review of the idea's AGGREGATE code change (the whole
#     feature across all its tasks). Gates: CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_
#     ENABLECODEREVIEWER=true (default), proposal inputType=="idea", every
#     task of THIS proposal done/closed. Read-only — emits a reminder only.
#
#   Branch B — Idea-completion report reminder
#     Tells the agent to call `chorus_create_report` when this proposal
#     is finished and has no report Document yet. Two checks: all tasks
#     of THIS proposal are done/closed, and THIS proposal has no
#     `type="report"` Document yet. The multi-proposal-per-Idea case is
#     handled by yolo's mandatory end-step, not by this hook.
#
# Each branch is computed independently into its own context variable;
# any non-empty contexts are concatenated and emitted as one
# `additionalContext` payload at the end, in order [A archive][C code
# review][B completion report] — code review precedes the completion
# report (the report must not be written while a code-review FAIL is
# outstanding). Any single branch firing alone produces exactly one
# reminder; multiple firing are joined by blank lines.
#
# Branches B and C are read-only — they never call a mutation tool; they
# only inject a reminder.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (per CLAUDE.md pitfall #10): no ${VAR,,}, no
# ${VAR^^}, no `declare -A`, no `mapfile`, no `readarray`, no `|&`,
# no `&>>`.
#
# All shell variable parsing of captured JSON uses
# `printf '%s' "$VAR" | jq ...` rather than `echo "$VAR" | jq ...` —
# echo corrupts multi-line content on `\n` (canonical §6 warning).

[Chorus Plugin — OpenSpec Archive Trigger]
The last task of OpenSpec-mode proposal ${PROPOSAL_UUID} (slug \`${slug}\`) has been admin-verified.

ACTION REQUIRED: archive the OpenSpec change locally and mirror updated specs back to the Chorus Documents. Run the steps below in order; HALT immediately on any error (canonical §6 — no silent errors).

1. Run \`openspec archive ${slug}\` in the repo root. This moves \`openspec/changes/${slug}/\` under \`openspec/changes/archive/<date>-${slug}/\` and emits/updates one \`openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md\` per capability. If the CLI prompts interactively and a \`--yes\`/\`--no-confirm\` flag is available, use it (verify with \`openspec archive --help\`).

2. For EACH newly-emitted \`openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:
   - List all spec-type Documents in this project: \`chorus_get_documents({projectUuid: "${PROJECT_UUID}", type: "spec"})\`. The \`type\` filter is the only server-side filter — do client-side title matching against the documents you get back.
   - Find the Document whose title matches the capability (canonical §3.8 mirror-back contract; typical title shape \`Spec: <capability>\`).
   - Call \`chorus_pm_update_document\` with the new content from the on-disk spec.md.

3. On any error from \`openspec archive\` or \`chorus_pm_update_document\`: print stderr verbatim, post a comment on the proposal recording the failure (\`chorus_add_comment({targetType: "proposal", targetUuid: "${PROPOSAL_UUID}", content: "..."})\`), and HALT. No retry, no silent skip.

4. Confirm each updated spec with \`verify-document-roundtrip.sh <local-spec-path> <document-uuid>\`; do not use recursive \`jq\`, \`head\`, command substitution, or newline normalization.

References: canonical openspec-aware §3.8 (mirror-back contract), §3.9 (this archive trigger), §6 (no silent errors).

[Chorus Plugin — Code-Review Gateway Trigger]
All tasks of idea-rooted proposal ${PROPOSAL_UUID} are now done. This is the final ship-time gateway for idea ${idea_uuid}.

ACTION REQUESTED: spawn code-reviewer for this idea — an independent, read-only review of the idea's AGGREGATE code change (the whole feature across all its tasks), not a single task.

1. Spawn the code-reviewer and wait for its completion notification, passing it ideaUuid="${idea_uuid}" and the review round number (read prior code-review verdict comments on the idea to determine it). It reviews cross-task integration, architecture/convention consistency, security, regression/performance, feature-level test coverage, and overall code soundness, then posts ONE VERDICT comment on the idea.
2. Read THIS round's VERDICT on the idea (chorus_get_comments targetType="idea") — the comment posted after your dispatch, not an earlier round's. The launch result is not the verdict; do not declare the feature shippable before you have read that comment. If it is missing, check what the reviewer did post: a comment reporting the round limit was reached, or any other explicit refusal to review, is a deliberate escalation — STOP: do not respawn, do not self-review, do not post a VERDICT of your own; leave it pending the human's decision. If it posted nothing at all, respawn once and apply this same check again to what the retry posts — an explicit refusal still means STOP; only a second true silence lets you review the idea's aggregate change yourself as a read-only pass and post the VERDICT. Absence is never a PASS.
3. PASS / PASS WITH NOTES -> the feature may ship.
4. FAIL -> the orchestrator invokes Quick Dev to create new tasks on the original approved proposal; never reopen completed tasks or apply untracked fixes. Group related small BLOCKERs by default and split only materially large or independently testable fixes.
5. Re-run only after every fix task passes AC self-check, independent task review, and admin verification to done. A failed or cancelled fix stops the loop and escalates. Keep maxCodeReviewRounds authoritative.

Run the code-review gateway BEFORE writing any idea-completion report — the report must not be written while a FAIL verdict is outstanding.
