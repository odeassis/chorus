# on-post-verify-task.sh — Kiro `postToolUse` hook matched to
# @chorus/chorus_admin_verify_task.

# Kiro contract: postToolUse delivers {tool_name, tool_input,

#
# Behavior (design D5 — code-review gateway): when the just-verified task
# is the LAST task of an idea-rooted proposal, emit a nudge to spawn the
# read-only `chorus-code-reviewer` subagent for the idea's AGGREGATE code
# change (the whole feature across all its tasks). Ported from the
# code-review branch of CC's on-post-verify-task.sh; the CC OpenSpec-archive
# and completion-report branches are out of scope for this hook per D5.
#
# Silent exit 0 (no nudge) when: no parseable taskUuid, the task has no
# proposal (Quick Task), the proposal is not idea-rooted, tasks remain
# non-terminal, or Chorus is unreachable.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (CLAUDE.md pitfall #10). All JSON is parsed with
# `printf '%s' "$VAR" | jq ...` (echo corrupts multi-line JSON on \n).

# Last task of an idea-rooted proposal verified -> emit the gateway nudge.
printf '%s\n' "[Chorus Plugin — Code-Review Gateway]
All tasks of idea-rooted proposal ${PROPOSAL_UUID} are now verified. This is the final ship-time gateway for idea ${IDEA_UUID}.

ACTION REQUESTED: spawn the read-only \`chorus-code-reviewer\` subagent for this idea — an independent review of the idea's AGGREGATE code change (the whole feature across all its tasks), not a single task. It is auto-selected by its description; you can also invoke it as /chorus-code-reviewer.

1. Spawn the code-reviewer and wait for the \`subagent\` call to return, passing ideaUuid=\"${IDEA_UUID}\" and the review round number (read prior code-review VERDICT comments on the idea to determine it). It reviews cross-task integration, architecture/convention consistency, security, regression/performance, feature-level test coverage, and overall soundness, then posts ONE VERDICT comment on the idea.
2. Read THIS round's VERDICT on the idea (chorus_get_comments targetType=\"idea\") — the comment posted after your dispatch, not an earlier round's. The \`subagent\` call's own return value is not the verdict; do not declare the feature shippable before you have read that comment. If it is missing, check what the reviewer did post: a comment reporting the round limit was reached, or any other explicit refusal to review, is a deliberate escalation — STOP: do not respawn, do not self-review, do not post a VERDICT of your own; leave it pending the human's decision. If it posted nothing at all, respawn once and apply this same check again to what the retry posts — an explicit refusal still means STOP; only a second true silence lets you review the idea's aggregate change yourself as a read-only pass and post the VERDICT. Absence is never a PASS.
3. VERDICT: PASS / PASS WITH NOTES — the feature may ship.
4. VERDICT: FAIL — the orchestrator invokes Quick Dev to create new tasks on the original approved proposal; never reopen completed tasks or apply untracked fixes. Group related small BLOCKERs by default and split only materially large or independently testable fixes.
5. Re-run only after every fix task passes AC self-check, independent task review, and admin verification to done. A failed or cancelled fix stops the loop and escalates. Keep maxCodeReviewRounds authoritative.

Run this code-review gateway BEFORE writing any idea-completion report — the report must not be written while a FAIL verdict is outstanding."
