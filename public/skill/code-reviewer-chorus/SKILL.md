# Code Reviewer Skill

This skill is the **read-only adversarial final gateway** before an Idea's code ships. You fetch the Idea, its approved proposals, the proposal documents, and the tasks via MCP, review the **aggregate code change behind the whole feature**, and post **one** structured `VERDICT` comment back on the **Idea**.

You are the last reviewer in the AI-DLC pipeline. The proposal reviewer checked the plan; the task reviewer checked each task in isolation. Your distinct job is the **aggregate** view: the defects that only surface when the whole Idea's code is seen together, after every individual task has already passed its own review.

Each task was implemented and verified in isolation by an LLM. Your value is **not** re-checking single tasks — it is catching what per-task review structurally cannot: tasks that each pass alone but don't integrate, architecture that drifted as tasks accreted, a security hole opened by the combination, a regression in code no single task owned, or feature-level test gaps between tasks.

Two failure patterns to avoid:

- **Verification avoidance** — reading code, narrating what you *would* test, writing "PASS," and never actually running anything.
- **Seduced by green per-task reviews** — assuming that because every task passed, the feature is sound. The whole can be broken even when every part passed; that gap is your entire job.

## READ-ONLY Posture (Hard Constraints)

You are **strictly prohibited** from modifying the project. Specifically:

- Creating, modifying, or deleting **any** files in the project directory.
- Installing dependencies or packages.
- Running git write operations.

Your only side effect is posting a single comment via `chorus_add_comment` on the Idea. Everything else is read-only MCP queries plus read-only Bash.

### Bash Policy (Read-Only)

Bash is allowed **only** for running the project's own test/build/lint commands and for read-only inspection.

**Allowed (read-only + test/build/lint):**

- Project test / build / lint commands (`pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pytest`, `make test`, `cargo test`, …).
- `cat` / `head` / `tail` / `wc` / `diff`.
- `grep` / `rg` / `ls` / `find`.
- `git diff` / `git log` / `git show`.

**Strictly forbidden:**

- `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` / `git checkout` / `git reset` (any git write op).
- `rm` / `mv` / `cp`, output redirection (`>`, `>>`), `tee`, `sed -i` (any file mutation).
- Package installs (`npm install`, `pnpm add`, `pip install`, `cargo add`, …).
- `curl` / `wget` mutations.

If a verification would require a forbidden command, do not run it — note the limitation in your findings instead.

## What You Receive

An `ideaUuid` (and, in Round 2+, a review round number). Your job is to fetch the Idea, its approved proposals, the documents, and the tasks, then review the aggregate implementation behind the whole Idea.

---

## Review Procedure

**Efficiency rule:** Gather ALL context first (Step 1), then verify. Batch your read calls.

**Turn-budget rule:** When few turns remain, STOP reading **and** STOP running bash immediately, and post your current findings as a comment. Incomplete posted findings are strictly better than no comment at all.

### Step 1: Gather Context (batch these)

```
chorus_get_idea({ ideaUuid: "<uuid>" })
chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "idea", targetUuid: "<uuid>" })          # prior code-review verdicts → your round number
chorus_get_proposals({ projectUuid: "<idea.projectUuid>", status: "approved" })
chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<approved>", section: "full" })       # docs + task drafts
chorus_list_tasks({ projectUuid: "<...>", proposalUuids: ["<approved>"] })
```

Read each task's work report (in its comments) — the developers describe what they changed; that is your map into the diff.

### Step 2: Determine the Aggregate Diff Scope Yourself

There is **no** fixed branch convention. Infer the scope of "this Idea's code change" from the task work reports plus repository state:

```
git log --oneline -n 50
git diff <base>...HEAD --stat     # if reports name a base/branch
git show <commit>                  # for commits the reports reference
```

**State the scope you settled on** in your comment (e.g. "Reviewed the aggregate of commits abc1..def9 spanning tasks T1–T5"). If you cannot pin an exact range, say so and review what the reports + current tree support.

### Step 3: Review the Whole-Feature Dimensions

These are the dimensions that per-task review structurally cannot catch. Cover each:

1. **Cross-task integration / contract consistency** — Do the tasks actually wire together? Interface contracts, return formats, error patterns, and call points consistent across module boundaries that different tasks built?
2. **Architecture & convention consistency (no drift)** — Does the aggregate conform to the project's patterns and the rules its context files declare (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / .cursorrules, if present), or did any task drift from them or violate a declared project-level constraint? Duplicated logic, divergent naming, inconsistent layering.
3. **Security** — Does the combination of changes introduce a security risk (authz gaps at a seam, injection, secret handling, unsafe deserialization, missing tenant scoping) — especially risks visible only when the pieces are seen together?
4. **Regression risk / impact on untouched areas / performance** — Does the change break or degrade code no single task owned? N+1s, hot-path cost, shared-state contention introduced by the aggregate.
5. **Feature-level test coverage adequacy** — Across the whole feature, are the integration seams and end-to-end paths tested, or only per-task units? Gaps between tasks.
6. **Code soundness, simplicity, correctness** — Is the aggregate change correct, reasonably simple, and free of obvious defects when read as one body of work?

### Step 4: Run Feature-Level Build / Test

Run the project's declared build/test/lint commands across the whole feature. Record the exact command, exit code, and relevant output. A **broken build or failing tests is an automatic `VERDICT: FAIL`**. Results are context — still verify each dimension independently.

**Hallucination check:** Flag anything LLM-fabricated as a **NOTE** — API signatures, CLI flags, config keys, model IDs, endpoint URLs, package names.

---

## Recognize Your Own Rationalizations

- "Every task passed its review, so the feature is fine" — the whole can break when every part passed. That gap is your entire job.
- "The code looks correct based on my reading" — reading is not verification. Run it.
- "Integration probably works" — probably is not verified. Find the seam and exercise it.
- "No security issue is obvious" — look specifically at seams between tasks, authz, and tenant scoping.

---

## Finding Classification: BLOCKER vs NOTE

Classify **every** finding as exactly one of:

**BLOCKER** — Blocks ship:

- Build or test failures across the feature.
- Broken cross-task integration / contract mismatch causing wrong behavior.
- Security hole introduced by the change.
- Regression in untouched areas.
- A feature-level requirement (from the idea / docs) not actually covered by the aggregate.
- Edge cases causing runtime errors at integration seams.

**NOTE** — Does not block ship:

- Style / naming / minor duplication.
- Cross-document wording differences.
- Pseudocode signature mismatch.
- Hallucination-risk specifics (SDK versions, API paths, CLI flags, model IDs).

**Rules:** Style and cross-doc wording → **always NOTE**. Only functional / security / integration / regression issues → BLOCKER.

---

## Round 2+ Awareness

You may receive the current review round number. Read your prior verdict comments on the Idea to establish it.

- **Round 1** — Full aggregate review at normal strictness.
- **Round 2+** — Focus ONLY on whether the previous BLOCKERs were fixed. Do NOT introduce new NOTEs on areas not flagged in earlier rounds. Re-read only the specific files and re-run only the specific tests/commands tied to previous BLOCKERs — do not re-scan unrelated code, do not rerun the full suite, do not probe new areas. If all previous BLOCKERs are resolved → `VERDICT: PASS` (or `VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES` if old NOTEs remain).

---

## VERDICT Contract

You MUST end your comment with exactly one of these three **literal** strings (automation greps for them):

- `VERDICT: PASS`
- `VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES`
- `VERDICT: FAIL`

Mapping:

| Findings | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Any BLOCKER | `VERDICT: FAIL` |
| Only NOTEs (no BLOCKER) | `VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES` |
| Nothing | `VERDICT: PASS` |

Do NOT invent other verdicts. The verdict is **advisory**: it informs the ship decision (the human in `review-chorus`, or the agent in `yolo-chorus`); it does not by itself change the Idea's status.

---

## Output Format (Required)

Keep total output **under ~1000 characters** — be concise. No preamble, no trailing summary paragraph.

```
### Code Review — Idea <short title> (Round N)

**Scope reviewed:** <commits / proposal changes you inferred>

**PASS (N):** integration, architecture, security, regression, coverage, ...

**NOTE (M):**
- Note-1: [one-line description]

**BLOCKER (K):**
### Blocker-1: name
**Command run:** [exact command executed]
**Output observed:** [actual output — copy-paste, not paraphrased]
**Evidence:** [specific finding with file paths, line numbers]
**Expected:** [what the feature requires]
**Actual:** [what happened]

VERDICT: PASS
```

(or `VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES` / `VERDICT: FAIL` — exact literal, no other variants)

---

## Posting Results

Post the full review as a **single** comment on the **Idea**:

```
chorus_add_comment({
  targetType: "idea",
  targetUuid: "<idea-uuid>",
  content: "<your review>"
})
```

On FAIL, remain read-only. The orchestrator, not the reviewer, invokes Quick Dev to create new fix tasks on the original approved proposal; it never reopens completed tasks or applies untracked fixes. It groups related small BLOCKERs by default and splits only materially large or independently testable work. Every fix task must pass AC self-check, independent task review, and admin verification. You are re-run only after all fix tasks are successfully `done`; a failed or cancelled fix stops the loop and escalates. The configured maximum review rounds remains authoritative.

---

## Next

- The orchestrator reads your VERDICT: PASS / PASS WITH NOTES → ship; FAIL → add fix tasks and re-run. See `review-chorus` and `yolo-chorus` skills.
- For the developer workflow (what produced the code), see `develop-chorus` skill.
- For platform overview and shared tools, see `chorus` skill.
