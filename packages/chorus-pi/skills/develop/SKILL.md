# Develop Skill

This skill covers the **Development** stage of the AI-DLC workflow: claiming Tasks, writing code, reporting progress, submitting for verification, and managing sessions for sub-agent observability.

---

## Overview

Developer Agents take Tasks created by PM Agents (via `/proposal`) and turn them into working code. Each task follows:

```
claim --> in_progress --> report work --> self-check AC --> submit for verify --> Admin /review
```

For multi-agent parallel execution, Chorus integrates with Pi subagents (parallel workers) with full session-based observability.

---

## Tools

**Task Lifecycle:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_claim_task` | Claim an open task (open -> assigned) |
| `chorus_release_task` | Release a claimed task (assigned -> open) |
| `chorus_update_task` | Update task status (in_progress / to_verify) |
| `chorus_submit_for_verify` | Submit task for admin verification with summary |

**Work Reporting:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_report_work` | Report progress or completion (writes comment + records activity, with optional status update) |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_report_criteria_self_check` | Report self-check results (passed/failed + optional evidence) on structured acceptance criteria |

**Session (sub-agents only — main agent skips these):**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_session_checkin_task` | Checkin to a task before starting work |
| `chorus_session_checkout_task` | Checkout from a task when work is done |

Sub-agents: always pass `sessionUuid` to `chorus_update_task` and `chorus_report_work` for attribution.
Main agent / Team Lead: call these tools without `sessionUuid` — no session needed.

**Shared tools** (checkin, query, comment, search, notifications): see `/chorus`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check In

```
chorus_checkin()
```

Review your persona, current assignments, and pending work counts.

### Step 1.5: Get Your Session (Sub-Agents Only)

**Skip if you are the main agent or Team Lead.**

If you are a **sub-agent** (spawned via `subagent_spawn`), the Chorus extension automatically creates your session and injects it into your task prompt — look for a `--- Chorus session (auto-injected) ---` section containing your `Session UUID`. Keep it for all task operations.

### Step 2: Find Work

```
chorus_get_available_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
```

Or check existing assignments:

```
chorus_get_my_assignments()
```

### Step 3: Claim a Task

```
chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })  # Review first
chorus_claim_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Check: description, acceptance criteria, priority, story points, related proposal/documents.

### Step 4: Gather Context

Each task and proposal includes a `commentCount` field — use it to decide which entities have discussions worth reading.

1. **Read the task** and identify dependencies:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```
   Pay attention to `dependsOn` (upstream tasks) and `commentCount`.

2. **Read task comments** (contains previous work reports, progress, feedback):
   ```
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```

3. **Review upstream dependency tasks** — your work likely builds on theirs:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<dependency-task-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<dependency-task-uuid>" })
   ```
   Look for: files created, API contracts, interfaces, trade-offs.

4. **Read the originating proposal** for design intent:
   ```
   chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>", section: "documents" })
   ```
   (`chorus_get_proposal` defaults to `section: "basic"` — just metadata + a draft index. Pass `section: "documents"` for the design docs, or `section: "full"` for docs + task drafts.)

5. **Read project documents** (PRD, tech design, ADR):
   ```
   chorus_get_documents({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
   ```

> **Document update flow (OpenSpec mode):** if the originating proposal `description` contains a line `OpenSpec change slug: <slug>`, the project's PRD / tech_design / spec Documents are **mirrors** of files under `openspec/changes/<slug>/`. To update such a Document (e.g. clarify an AC, fix a spec scenario before resubmitting), load the `openspec-aware` skill at `skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md` and follow §3.8: edit the local `.md` file first, then mirror through the `chorus-mcp-call.sh` wrapper with `json_encode_file` and `chorus_check_response`.
>
> **⛔ Do not** call `chorus_pm_update_document` directly from the MCP harness with a hand-typed `content` field in OpenSpec mode. The local file is the source of truth; agent-typed content drifts and burns tokens (`openspec-aware` §2 Rule 1).
>
> When the LAST task of an OpenSpec idea is verified, the extension injects an archive reminder (`openspec-aware` §3.9) — run `openspec archive <slug> --yes`, then mirror each emitted `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` back via §3.8.
>
> In the no-OpenSpec fallback (no slug line, or no `openspec` CLI), edit the Document content directly via the existing MCP tool with no wrapper, no local file step.

### Step 5: Start Working

**Sub-agent**: checkin to the task first:
```
chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Then mark as in-progress:
```
# Sub-agent:
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>", status: "in_progress", sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>" })

# Main agent:
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>", status: "in_progress" })
```

> **Dependency enforcement**: If this task has unresolved dependencies (dependsOn tasks not in `done` or `closed`), the call will be rejected with detailed blocker info. Use `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` to find tasks you can start now.

### Step 6: Report Progress

Report periodically with `chorus_report_work`. Include:
- What was completed
- Files created or modified
- Git commits and PRs
- Current status / remaining work
- Blockers or questions

```
chorus_report_work({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  report: "Progress:\n- Created src/services/auth.service.ts\n- Commit: abc1234\n- Remaining: unit tests",
  sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>"
})
```

Report with status update when complete:
```
chorus_report_work({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  report: "All implementation complete:\n- Files: ...\n- PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42\n- All tests passing",
  status: "to_verify",
  sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>"
})
```

### Step 7: Self-Check Acceptance Criteria

Before submitting, check structured acceptance criteria:

```
task = chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })

# If task.acceptanceCriteriaItems is non-empty:
chorus_report_criteria_self_check({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  criteria: [
    { uuid: "<criterion-uuid>", devStatus: "passed", devEvidence: "Unit tests cover this" },
    { uuid: "<criterion-uuid>", devStatus: "passed", devEvidence: "Verified manually" }
  ]
})
```

> For **required** criteria, keep working until you can self-check as `passed`. Only use `failed` for **optional** criteria that are out of scope.

### Step 8: Submit for Verification

**Sub-agents** — checkout first:
```
chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Then submit:
```
chorus_submit_for_verify({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  summary: "Implemented auth feature:\n- Added login/logout endpoints\n- JWT middleware\n- 95% test coverage\n- All AC self-checked (3/3 passed)"
})
```

> `to_verify` does NOT unblock downstream tasks — only `done` (after admin verification) does.

> **Review Agent:** After `chorus_submit_for_verify`, the Chorus extension nudges you to spawn `chorus-task-reviewer` — an independent, read-only review agent. You MUST spawn it yourself (it is NOT auto-launched). **Use the blocking `subagent` tool** (it waits for the VERDICT and returns it) — wait for the VERDICT before proceeding. The reviewer posts a VERDICT comment on the task.

After the reviewer completes, read its VERDICT:
```
chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```
Find the most recent comment containing `VERDICT:` and act on it:

- **VERDICT: PASS** — All AC verified, no issues. Proceed to admin verification.
- **VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES** — All AC verified, minor notes. Proceed to admin verification (notes are non-blocking).
- **VERDICT: FAIL** — BLOCKERs found. Do NOT verify. Fix the BLOCKERs listed in the reviewer's comment, then resubmit.

If no new `VERDICT:` comment appears after the reviewer returns, it exhausted its turn budget before posting. Respawn it ONCE with a concise-budget hint in the prompt: *"Stay within turn budget. Skip deep verification. Fetch task/proposal/comments, run only the core tests, and post your VERDICT comment within the first 12 turns."* If the second attempt still produces no VERDICT, review manually using the checklist and proceed.

> **Final code-review gateway (after the Idea's LAST task is verified):** when the task you just verified is the **last** task of its idea-rooted proposal, the feature is about to ship — the extension nudges you to spawn `chorus-code-reviewer` (gated by `CHORUS_ENABLE_CODE_REVIEWER`, default on). Spawn it yourself via the blocking `subagent` tool, passing the `ideaUuid` + round number; it reviews the Idea's **aggregate** code change across all its tasks (cross-task integration, architecture, security, regression, feature-level coverage) and posts one `VERDICT` comment on the **idea**. `PASS` / `PASS WITH NOTES` → ship; `FAIL` → fix via `/skill:quick-dev` (`chorus_create_tasks` with `proposalUuid` set to the current approved proposal so the fix tasks attach to it — do NOT reopen the verified tasks). Group related small BLOCKERs by default; split only materially large or independently testable fixes. Require AC self-check, independent task review, and admin verification for every fix task. Re-run aggregate review only after every fix is successfully `done`; a failed or cancelled fix stops the loop and escalates, bounded by `CHORUS_MAX_CODE_REVIEW_ROUNDS` (env, default 3; 0 = unlimited). Advisory/behavioral, like the other reviewers. Run it **before** any idea-completion report.

### Step 9: Handle Review Feedback

If the reviewer returns **FAIL**, or the task is reopened after verification:

**All acceptance criteria are reset to pending** when a task is reopened.

1. Check feedback:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```
2. Fix every BLOCKER listed in the reviewer's FAIL comment.
3. Checkin again, fix issues, report fixes, resubmit.

### Step 10: Task Complete

Once Admin verifies (status: `done`), move to the next available task (back to Step 2).

### Step 11: Idea Completion Report (advisory)

If the task you just self-verified was the LAST one of its Idea (every Task across every approved Proposal is now `done`/`closed`) and you have `document:write`, offer to call `chorus_create_report` via `AskUserQuestion`. The `content` parameter's description carries the section template. Skip on decline — the extension will remind on the next run.

---

## Session (Sub-Agents Only)

The Chorus extension **fully automates** session lifecycle — creation (on `subagent_spawn`, via `tool_call` task injection) and cleanup (on `subagent_manage close`) are handled by the extension. Sub-agents only do 3 things manually:

1. `chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid, taskUuid })` — before starting work
2. `chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid, taskUuid })` — when done (recommended; plugin also auto-checkouts on exit)
3. Pass `sessionUuid` to `chorus_update_task` and `chorus_report_work` for attribution

**Main agent / Team Lead**: no session needed — call tools without `sessionUuid`.

---

## Parallel Sub-Agent Integration

When using Pi's subagents (`pi-subagents`) to run multiple sub-agents in parallel, Chorus provides full work observability. The `chorus-pi` extension automates the session lifecycle: when you `subagent_spawn` a worker, it creates a Chorus session and injects the session UUID + workflow into the worker's task; when you `subagent_manage close` the agent, it closes the session.

### Two-Layer Architecture

| Layer | System | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Orchestration** | Pi subagents (`subagent_spawn` / `subagent_send` / `subagent_mailbox`) | Spawning sub-agents, follow-up tasks, inter-agent messaging |
| **Work Tracking** | Chorus | Task lifecycle, session observability, activity stream |

### Team Lead Workflow

```
# 1. Check in and plan
chorus_checkin()
chorus_list_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })

# 2. Spawn sub-agents (async — returns immediately with an agentId)
# Pass only task UUIDs — the chorus-pi extension auto-injects the session
# UUID + workflow into the worker's task.
subagent_spawn({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Your Chorus task UUID: <task-uuid>\nProject UUID: <project-uuid>\n\nImplement..."
})
# → returns agentId (sa_<uuid>); keep it to close the agent later.
```

**What the Team Lead prompt needs:**
- Task UUID(s)
- NO session UUID, NO workflow boilerplate — the extension auto-injects everything
- The `agentId` returned by `subagent_spawn` (needed to `subagent_manage close` later)

### Sub-Agent Workflow

The extension injects the session UUID + workflow into the sub-agent's task automatically (at `tool_call` time, before the subprocess starts). The sub-agent reads the `Session UUID:` from its task prompt and follows the injected steps:

```
# 1. Checkin to task (sessionUuid comes from the auto-injected task)
chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>" })

# 2. Move to in_progress
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", status: "in_progress", sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>" })

# 3. Do work... code, test, commit...

# 4. Report progress
chorus_report_work({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", report: "...", sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>" })

# 5. Checkout and submit
chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>" })
chorus_submit_for_verify({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", summary: "..." })

# 6. (Optional) notify the team lead via mailbox — you need its agentId
subagent_mailbox({ action: "send", agentId: "<team-lead-agentId>", message: "Task complete" })

# DO NOT call chorus_close_session — the extension closes it when the
# team lead runs subagent_manage({ action: "close", agentId: "<my-agentId>" })
```

### Handling Task Dependencies (DAG)

> **Server-side enforcement**: `chorus_update_task(status: "in_progress")` rejects if any `dependsOn` task is not `done` or `closed`.

**Wave-based execution (recommended):**
1. `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` — find ready tasks
2. `subagent_spawn` workers for Wave 1 (async; keep the agentIds)
3. Wait for `to_verify` (poll `chorus_list_tasks` or read the async completion messages), then **verify each task** (`chorus_admin_verify_task` → `done`)
4. `subagent_manage close` each finished worker (releases its slot + closes its Chorus session)
5. `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` — find newly unblocked tasks (Wave 2)
6. Repeat until all tasks done

> **Critical:** `to_verify` does NOT resolve dependencies — only `done` or `closed` does. The Team Lead must verify tasks between waves. Also remember to `subagent_manage close` finished workers — Pi limits concurrent sub-agents and `completed` does not release the slot.

### Multiple Tasks Per Sub-Agent

A single sub-agent can work on multiple tasks sequentially:

```
subagent_spawn({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Your Chorus tasks (work in order):\n1. task-schema-uuid\n2. task-api-uuid (depends on #1)\n\nFor EACH task: checkin -> in_progress -> work -> report -> checkout -> submit_for_verify"
})
```

### MCP Access for Sub-Agents

Sub-agents need MCP configured at **project level** (`.mcp.json`) or **user level** (`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`). The chorus-pi extension's session injection works regardless, because it calls chorus over its own MCP-over-HTTP fetch (not the sub-agent's gateway).

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Sub-agent can't access Chorus MCP tools | Verify MCP is configured at project level, API key has developer role |
| UI doesn't show active workers | Sub-agent forgot `chorus_session_checkin_task`. Check: `chorus_get_session` |
| Session disappears from Settings | No activity for 1h (default lists hide stale sessions). The session row still exists — it's reachable via MCP `chorus_list_sessions` / `chorus_get_session`. Send a heartbeat (or any session-touching tool) to make it visible again, or check whether the agent crashed |
| Task stuck in wrong status | Spawn new sub-agent with same name (plugin auto-reopens session), or use `chorus_update_task` to reset |
| Duplicate sessions | Never call `chorus_create_session` — plugin handles all session creation. Close extras via Settings page |
| Sub-agent didn't receive session | Check plugin is loaded (`/plugin list`) and `CHORUS_URL` is set. Ensure `name` parameter is set |

## Work Report Best Practices

**Good report (enables session continuity):**
```
Implemented password reset flow:

Files created/modified:
- src/services/auth.service.ts (new)
- src/app/api/auth/reset/route.ts (new)
- tests/auth/reset.test.ts (new)

Git:
- Commit: a1b2c3d "feat: password reset flow"
- PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/15

Implementation details:
- POST /api/auth/reset-request: sends email with token
- Token expires after 1 hour, single-use
- Rate limiting: 3 requests/hour/email
- 12 new tests, all passing

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] User can request reset via email
- [x] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse
```

**Bad report:** `Done.`

---

## Tips

- **Read task comments first** — they contain previous work reports for session continuity
- **Check upstream dependencies** — read `dependsOn` tasks and their comments for interfaces/APIs
- **Read the originating proposal** — understand design rationale and task DAG
- **Use `commentCount`** — skip fetching comments on entities with count 0
- Report progress frequently — include file paths, commits, and PRs
- Write detailed submit summaries — Admin needs them to verify
- If blocked, add a comment and consider releasing the task
- One task at a time: finish or release before claiming another
- Use meaningful sub-agent names — they become Chorus session names

---

## When to Release a Task

Release if:
- You can't complete it (missing knowledge, blocked)
- A higher-priority task needs attention
- You won't finish in a reasonable timeframe

```
chorus_release_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
chorus_add_comment({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>", content: "Releasing: reason..." })
```

---

## Next

- After submitting for verification, an Admin reviews using `/review`
- **Human "Start Development" wake:** a `start_development` wake (the human clicked **Start Development** on the idea-detail panel) means: claim and execute ALL remaining tasks of the idea's approved proposal in dependency order — loop this workflow until no claimable task remains, leaving `to_verify` and other-session tasks untouched.
- **Human "Yolo" wake:** a `yolo_requested` wake (the human clicked **Yolo** on the idea-detail panel) means: drive the WHOLE idea to done via the yolo skill (the full-auto AI-DLC pipeline), not just the execute stage — read the idea's current state and resume from whatever phase it is in. Unlike `start_development` it is stage-adaptive, and it must never merge or push a PR without explicit human approval.
