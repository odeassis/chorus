# Develop Skill

This skill covers the **Development** stage of the AI-DLC workflow: claiming Tasks, writing code, reporting progress, submitting for verification, and managing sessions for sub-agent observability.

---

## Overview

Developer Agents take Tasks created by PM Agents (via `/proposal`) and turn them into working code. Each task follows:

```
claim --> in_progress --> report work --> self-check AC --> submit for verify --> Admin /review
```

For multi-agent parallel execution, Chorus integrates with Pi subagents (parallel workers) with full session-based observability.

---

## Tools

**Task Lifecycle:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_claim_task` | Claim an open task (open -> assigned) |
| `chorus_release_task` | Release a claimed task (assigned -> open) |
| `chorus_update_task` | Update task status (in_progress / to_verify) |
| `chorus_submit_for_verify` | Submit task for admin verification with summary |

**Work Reporting:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_report_work` | Report progress or completion (writes comment + records activity, with optional status update) |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_report_criteria_self_check` | Report self-check results (passed/failed + optional evidence) on structured acceptance criteria |

**Session (sub-agents only — main agent skips these):**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chorus_session_checkin_task` | Checkin to a task before starting work |
| `chorus_session_checkout_task` | Checkout from a task when work is done |

Sub-agents: always pass `sessionUuid` to `chorus_update_task` and `chorus_report_work` for attribution.
Main agent / Team Lead: call these tools without `sessionUuid` — no session needed.

**Shared tools** (checkin, query, comment, search, notifications): see `/chorus`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check In

```
chorus_checkin()
```

Review your persona, current assignments, and pending work counts.

### Step 1.5: Get Your Session (Sub-Agents Only)

**Skip if you are the main agent or Team Lead.**

If you are a **sub-agent** (dispatched via the `subagent` tool), the Chorus extension automatically creates your session and injects it into your task prompt — look for a `--- Chorus session (auto-injected) ---` section containing your `Session UUID`. Keep it for all task operations.

### Step 2: Find Work

```
chorus_get_available_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
```

Or check existing assignments:

```
chorus_get_my_assignments()
```

### Step 3: Claim a Task

```
chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })  # Review first
chorus_claim_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Check: description, acceptance criteria, priority, story points, related proposal/documents.

### Step 4: Gather Context

Each task and proposal includes a `commentCount` field — use it to decide which entities have discussions worth reading.

1. **Read the task** and identify dependencies:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```
   Pay attention to `dependsOn` (upstream tasks) and `commentCount`.

2. **Read task comments** (contains previous work reports, progress, feedback):
   ```
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```

3. **Review upstream dependency tasks** — your work likely builds on theirs:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<dependency-task-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<dependency-task-uuid>" })
   ```
   Look for: files created, API contracts, interfaces, trade-offs.

4. **Read the originating proposal** for design intent:
   ```
   chorus_get_proposal({ proposalUuid: "<proposal-uuid>", section: "documents" })
   ```
   (`chorus_get_proposal` defaults to `section: "basic"` — just metadata + a draft index. Pass `section: "documents"` for the design docs, or `section: "full"` for docs + task drafts.)

5. **Read project documents** (PRD, tech design, ADR):
   ```
   chorus_get_documents({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })
   ```

> **Document update flow (OpenSpec mode):** if the originating proposal `description` contains a line `OpenSpec change slug: <slug>`, the project's PRD / tech_design / spec Documents are **mirrors** of files under `openspec/changes/<slug>/`. To update such a Document (e.g. clarify an AC, fix a spec scenario before resubmitting), load the `openspec-aware` skill at `skills/openspec-aware/SKILL.md` and follow §3.8: edit the local `.md` file first, then mirror it — prefer `chorus mcp call … --arg-file content=<file>`, falling back to the `chorus-mcp-call.sh` wrapper with `json_encode_file` when `chorus` is not on `PATH` — with `chorus_check_response` halting on error.
>
> **⛔ Do not** call `chorus_pm_update_document` directly from the MCP harness with a hand-typed `content` field in OpenSpec mode. The local file is the source of truth; agent-typed content drifts and burns tokens (`openspec-aware` §2 Rule 1).
>
> When the LAST task of an OpenSpec idea is verified, the extension injects an archive reminder (`openspec-aware` §3.9) — run `openspec archive <slug> --yes`, then mirror each emitted `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` back via §3.8.
>
> **Document update flow (spec-lite mode):** if the proposal `description` contains a line `Spec-lite: .chorus/specs/<slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<change-slug>/`, the project's PRD / tech_design / … Documents are **mirrors** of the files in that dated folder. To update such a Document, load the `spec-lite` skill (`/skill:spec-lite`) and follow its Mirror section: edit the local `<type>.md` file first, then mirror it via `chorus mcp call chorus_pm_update_document "{\"documentUuid\":\"<uuid>\"}" --arg-file content=<file>` (recorded `documentUuid` from the file's frontmatter), falling back to the `chorus-mcp-call.sh` wrapper when `chorus` is not on `PATH`, `chorus_check_response` halting on error. Same **⛔ do-not-hand-type-`content`** rule as OpenSpec. The durable `.chorus/specs/<slug>/spec.md` is edited in place too but is **never mirrored** (git history is its record). No archive flow — spec-lite has no CLI/validate/archive; on delivery just set `spec.md` `status: done`.
>
> In the no-OpenSpec, no-spec-lite fallback (free-form: no locator line), edit the Document content directly via the existing MCP tool with no wrapper, no local file step.

### Step 5: Start Working

**Sub-agent**: checkin to the task first:
```
chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Then mark as in-progress:
```
# Sub-agent:
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>", status: "in_progress", sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>" })

# Main agent:
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>", status: "in_progress" })
```

> **Dependency enforcement**: If this task has unresolved dependencies (dependsOn tasks not in `done` or `closed`), the call will be rejected with detailed blocker info. Use `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` to find tasks you can start now.

### Step 6: Report Progress

Report periodically with `chorus_report_work`. Include:
- What was completed
- Files created or modified
- Git commits and PRs
- Current status / remaining work
- Blockers or questions

```
chorus_report_work({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  report: "Progress:\n- Created src/services/auth.service.ts\n- Commit: abc1234\n- Remaining: unit tests",
  sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>"
})
```

Report with status update when complete:
```
chorus_report_work({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  report: "All implementation complete:\n- Files: ...\n- PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42\n- All tests passing",
  status: "to_verify",
  sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>"
})
```

### Step 7: Self-Check Acceptance Criteria

Before submitting, check structured acceptance criteria:

```
task = chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })

# If task.acceptanceCriteriaItems is non-empty:
chorus_report_criteria_self_check({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  criteria: [
    { uuid: "<criterion-uuid>", devStatus: "passed", devEvidence: "Unit tests cover this" },
    { uuid: "<criterion-uuid>", devStatus: "passed", devEvidence: "Verified manually" }
  ]
})
```

> For **required** criteria, keep working until you can self-check as `passed`. Only use `failed` for **optional** criteria that are out of scope.

### Step 8: Submit for Verification

**Sub-agents** — checkout first:
```
chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid: "<session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```

Then submit:
```
chorus_submit_for_verify({
  taskUuid: "<task-uuid>",
  summary: "Implemented auth feature:\n- Added login/logout endpoints\n- JWT middleware\n- 95% test coverage\n- All AC self-checked (3/3 passed)"
})
```

> `to_verify` does NOT unblock downstream tasks — only `done` (after admin verification) does.

> **Review Agent:** After `chorus_submit_for_verify`, the Chorus extension nudges you to spawn `chorus-task-reviewer` — an independent, read-only review agent. You MUST spawn it yourself (it is NOT auto-launched). **Use the blocking `subagent` tool** (it waits for the VERDICT and returns it) — wait for the VERDICT before proceeding. The reviewer posts a VERDICT comment on the task.

After the reviewer completes, read its VERDICT:
```
chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
```
Find THIS round's `VERDICT:` comment — the one posted after your dispatch, not an older round's — and act on it:

- **VERDICT: PASS** — All AC verified, no issues. Proceed to admin verification.
- **VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES** — All AC verified, minor notes. Proceed to admin verification (notes are non-blocking).
- **VERDICT: FAIL** — BLOCKERs found. Do NOT verify. Fix the BLOCKERs listed in the reviewer's comment, then resubmit.

If no new `VERDICT:` comment appears after the reviewer returns, check what it *did* post. A comment reporting that the round limit was reached, or any other explicit refusal to review, is a deliberate escalation to a human: STOP — do not respawn, do not self-review, do not post a VERDICT of your own. If it posted nothing at all, respawn it ONCE, telling it to stay within its turn budget and reserve its last turns for the VERDICT, then apply this same check again to what the retry posts. An explicit refusal from the retry still means STOP; only a second true silence lets you review the task yourself as a read-only pass using the checklist and POST the VERDICT comment. **Absence is never a PASS.**

> **Final code-review gateway (after the Idea's LAST task is verified):** when the task you just verified is the **last** task of its idea-rooted proposal, the feature is about to ship — the extension nudges you to spawn `chorus-code-reviewer` (gated by `CHORUS_ENABLE_CODE_REVIEWER`, default on). Spawn it yourself via the blocking `subagent` tool, passing the `ideaUuid` + round number; it reviews the Idea's **aggregate** code change across all its tasks (cross-task integration, architecture, security, regression, feature-level coverage) and posts one `VERDICT` comment on the **idea**. `PASS` / `PASS WITH NOTES` → ship; `FAIL` → fix via `/skill:quick-dev` (`chorus_create_tasks` with `proposalUuid` set to the current approved proposal so the fix tasks attach to it — do NOT reopen the verified tasks). Group related small BLOCKERs by default; split only materially large or independently testable fixes. Require AC self-check, independent task review, and admin verification for every fix task. Re-run aggregate review only after every fix is successfully `done`; a failed or cancelled fix stops the loop and escalates, bounded by `CHORUS_MAX_CODE_REVIEW_ROUNDS` (env, default 3; 0 = unlimited). Advisory/behavioral, like the other reviewers. Run it **before** any idea-completion report.

### Step 9: Handle Review Feedback

If the reviewer returns **FAIL**, or the task is reopened after verification:

**All acceptance criteria are reset to pending** when a task is reopened.

1. Check feedback:
   ```
   chorus_get_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   chorus_get_comments({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
   ```
2. Fix every BLOCKER listed in the reviewer's FAIL comment.
3. Checkin again, fix issues, report fixes, resubmit.

### Step 10: Task Complete

Once Admin verifies (status: `done`), move to the next available task (back to Step 2).

### Step 11: Idea Completion Report (advisory)

If the task you just self-verified was the LAST one of its Idea (every Task across every approved Proposal is now `done`/`closed`) and you have `document:write`, offer to call `chorus_create_report` via `AskUserQuestion`. The call requires `title` (a short report title) plus `content`; `content`'s parameter description carries the three-section template (`## Summary` / `## Decisions` / `## Follow-ups`). Skip on decline — the extension will remind on the next run.

---

## Session (Sub-Agents Only)

The Chorus extension **fully automates** session lifecycle — a Chorus session is created (on `subagent` dispatch, via `tool_call` task injection) and closed (when the blocking `subagent` call returns) by the extension. Sub-agents only do 3 things manually:

1. `chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid, taskUuid })` — before starting work
2. `chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid, taskUuid })` — when done (recommended; plugin also auto-checkouts on exit)
3. Pass `sessionUuid` to `chorus_update_task` and `chorus_report_work` for attribution

**Main agent / Team Lead**: no session needed — call tools without `sessionUuid`.

---

## Parallel Sub-Agent Integration

Use the `subagent` tool to run multiple Chorus workers in parallel; Chorus provides full work observability. The `subagent` tool is **blocking** — a parallel dispatch runs every worker to completion and returns their aggregated output in one call (there is no async spawn, no `agentId`, and no manual close). The `chorus-pi` extension automates session lifecycle: when you dispatch a `chorus-worker`, it creates a Chorus session and injects the session UUID + workflow into that worker's task; when the `subagent` call returns, it closes the session.

> The `subagent` tool has three modes — **single** (`{ agent, task }`), **parallel** (`{ tasks: [...] }`, max 8 per call, concurrency 4), and **chain** (`{ chain: [...] }`, sequential with a `{previous}` placeholder). Dispatch `agent: "chorus-worker"` for Chorus task implementation.

### Two-Layer Architecture

| Layer | System | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Orchestration** | The `subagent` tool (single / parallel / chain) | Dispatching workers to isolated pi subprocesses and collecting their results |
| **Work Tracking** | Chorus | Task lifecycle, session observability, activity stream |

### Team Lead Workflow

```
# 1. Check in and plan
chorus_checkin()
chorus_list_tasks({ projectUuid: "<project-uuid>" })

# 2. Dispatch a worker per ready task in ONE blocking parallel call (max 8).
# Pass only task + project UUIDs — the chorus-pi extension auto-injects the
# session UUID + workflow into each worker's task.
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "chorus-worker",
      task: "Your Chorus task UUID: <task-uuid>\nProject UUID: <project-uuid>\n\nImplement..." },
    // ... one entry per ready task, max 8 (batch into multiple calls if more)
  ]
})
# The call BLOCKS until every worker finishes and returns their outputs.
# For a single task, use single mode: subagent({ agent: "chorus-worker", task: "..." })
```

**What the Team Lead prompt needs:**
- Task UUID(s) + Project UUID
- NO session UUID, NO workflow boilerplate — the extension auto-injects everything
- No `agentId` to track and no close step — the blocking call owns the worker's whole lifecycle

### Sub-Agent Workflow

The extension injects the session UUID + workflow into the worker's task automatically (at `tool_call` time, before the subprocess starts). The worker reads the `Session UUID:` from its task prompt and follows the injected steps:

```
# 1. Checkin to task (sessionUuid comes from the auto-injected task)
chorus_session_checkin_task({ sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>" })

# 2. Move to in_progress
chorus_update_task({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", status: "in_progress", sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>" })

# 3. Do work... code, test, commit...

# 4. Report progress
chorus_report_work({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", report: "...", sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>" })

# 5. Checkout and submit
chorus_session_checkout_task({ sessionUuid: "<my-session-uuid>", taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>" })
chorus_submit_for_verify({ taskUuid: "<my-task-uuid>", summary: "..." })

# The worker's final message is returned to the Team Lead as the subagent result.
# DO NOT call chorus_close_session — the extension closes the session when the
# blocking `subagent` call returns.
```

### Handling Task Dependencies (DAG)

> **Server-side enforcement**: `chorus_update_task(status: "in_progress")` rejects if any `dependsOn` task is not `done` or `closed`.

**Wave-based execution (recommended):**
1. `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` — find ready tasks
2. Dispatch a `chorus-worker` per ready task in ONE blocking `subagent({ tasks: [...] })` call (max 8; batch if more). The call returns when the whole wave has finished (each worker at `to_verify`).
3. **Verify each task** — spawn `chorus-task-reviewer`, act on its VERDICT, then `chorus_admin_verify_task` → `done`.
4. `chorus_get_unblocked_tasks` — find newly unblocked tasks (Wave 2)
5. Repeat until all tasks done

> **Critical:** `to_verify` does NOT resolve dependencies — only `done` or `closed` does. The Team Lead must verify tasks between waves. The blocking `subagent` call already released each worker's slot on return, so there is nothing to close.

### Multiple Tasks Per Sub-Agent

A single worker can handle several tasks sequentially — use single mode with an ordered list:

```
subagent({
  agent: "chorus-worker",
  task: "Your Chorus tasks (work in order):\n1. task-schema-uuid\n2. task-api-uuid (depends on #1)\n\nFor EACH task: checkin -> in_progress -> work -> report -> checkout -> submit_for_verify"
})
```

For strictly dependent stages where each step consumes the previous output, use chain mode: `subagent({ chain: [{ agent: "chorus-worker", task: "..." }, { agent: "chorus-worker", task: "... {previous} ..." }] })`.

### MCP Access for Sub-Agents

Sub-agents need MCP configured at **project level** (`.mcp.json`) or **user level** (`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`). The chorus-pi extension's session injection works regardless, because it calls chorus over its own MCP-over-HTTP fetch (not the sub-agent's gateway).

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Sub-agent can't access Chorus MCP tools | Verify MCP is configured at project level, API key has developer role |
| UI doesn't show active workers | Sub-agent forgot `chorus_session_checkin_task`. Check: `chorus_get_session` |
| Session disappears from Settings | No activity for 1h (default lists hide stale sessions). The session row still exists — it's reachable via MCP `chorus_list_sessions` / `chorus_get_session`. Send a heartbeat (or any session-touching tool) to make it visible again, or check whether the agent crashed |
| Task stuck in wrong status | Spawn new sub-agent with same name (plugin auto-reopens session), or use `chorus_update_task` to reset |
| Duplicate sessions | Never call `chorus_create_session` — plugin handles all session creation. Close extras via Settings page |
| Sub-agent didn't receive session | Check plugin is loaded (`/plugin list`) and `CHORUS_URL` is set. Ensure `name` parameter is set |

## Work Report Best Practices

**Good report (enables session continuity):**
```
Implemented password reset flow:

Files created/modified:
- src/services/auth.service.ts (new)
- src/app/api/auth/reset/route.ts (new)
- tests/auth/reset.test.ts (new)

Git:
- Commit: a1b2c3d "feat: password reset flow"
- PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/15

Implementation details:
- POST /api/auth/reset-request: sends email with token
- Token expires after 1 hour, single-use
- Rate limiting: 3 requests/hour/email
- 12 new tests, all passing

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] User can request reset via email
- [x] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse
```

**Bad report:** `Done.`

---

## Tips

- **Read task comments first** — they contain previous work reports for session continuity
- **Check upstream dependencies** — read `dependsOn` tasks and their comments for interfaces/APIs
- **Read the originating proposal** — understand design rationale and task DAG
- **Use `commentCount`** — skip fetching comments on entities with count 0
- Report progress frequently — include file paths, commits, and PRs
- Write detailed submit summaries — Admin needs them to verify
- If blocked, add a comment and consider releasing the task
- One task at a time: finish or release before claiming another
- Use meaningful sub-agent names — they become Chorus session names

---

## When to Release a Task

Release if:
- You can't complete it (missing knowledge, blocked)
- A higher-priority task needs attention
- You won't finish in a reasonable timeframe

```
chorus_release_task({ taskUuid: "<task-uuid>" })
chorus_add_comment({ targetType: "task", targetUuid: "<task-uuid>", content: "Releasing: reason..." })
```

---

## Next

- After submitting for verification, an Admin reviews using `/review`
- **Human "Start Development" wake:** a `start_development` wake (the human clicked **Start Development** on the idea-detail panel) means: claim and execute ALL remaining tasks of the idea's approved proposal in dependency order — loop this workflow until no claimable task remains, leaving `to_verify` and other-session tasks untouched.
- **Human "Yolo" wake:** a `yolo_requested` wake (the human clicked **Yolo** on the idea-detail panel) means: drive the WHOLE idea to done via the yolo skill (the full-auto AI-DLC pipeline), not just the execute stage — read the idea's current state and resume from whatever phase it is in. Unlike `start_development` it is stage-adaptive, and it must never merge or push a PR without explicit human approval.
