CTX="[Chorus — Proposal Submitted for Review]
Proposal ${PROPOSAL_UUID:-<uuid>} has been submitted.

ACTION REQUIRED: Spawn the \`chorus-proposal-reviewer\` sub-agent to perform an independent quality review before admin approval.

How to spawn (mount the reviewer skill explicitly):
  reviewer = spawn_agent({
    items: [
      { type: \"skill\", name: \"Chorus Proposal Reviewer\", path: \"chorus:chorus-proposal-reviewer\" },
      { type: \"text\",  text: \"Review proposal ${PROPOSAL_UUID:-<uuid>}. Max review rounds: 3. First read existing comments to determine round number; post VERDICT as a comment.\" }
    ]
  })
  wait_agent({ targets: [reviewer.agent_id] })
  close_agent({ target: reviewer.agent_id })    # completed != closed

This gate depends on the verdict, so wait here. Routine entity-backed reviewers use a fresh context; set \`fork_context: true\` only when material parent-conversation state cannot be conveyed in the text item. Use \`send_input\` for an active reviewer and \`resume_agent\` only for one that was previously closed.

The reviewer is read-only and posts its VERDICT as a comment on the proposal. Read comments after it returns and find THIS round's \`VERDICT:\` line — the comment posted after you dispatched the reviewer, not an older round's:
- **VERDICT: PASS** — No issues. Proceed to \`chorus_admin_approve_proposal\`.
- **VERDICT: PASS WITH NOTES** — Minor notes. Still approve.
- **VERDICT: FAIL** — BLOCKERs found. Do NOT approve. Reject with \`chorus_pm_reject_proposal\`, fix, resubmit."
