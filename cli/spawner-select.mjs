// cli/spawner-select.mjs
// Backend selection seam: maps the resolved agent type (daemon-agent.mjs) to a
// concrete Spawner instance. This is the ONLY place the daemon branches on the
// backend — the wake pipeline above it (queue, waker, directed delivery, headless
// guard, reporters) stays backend-agnostic and drives whichever spawner is
// injected purely through the shared wake(...) contract.
//
// The function is TOTAL: resolveAgentType has already rejected unknown values
// before this runs, so an UNRECOGNIZED type here is not a user error path — we
// fall back to the safe default (claude-code) rather than throw.
//
// The `offline` type is the ONE known value that must NEVER reach that default:
// it is a non-wakeable classification (an agent parked in daemon.json only for the
// `chorus mcp` proxy key), so it gets an explicit branch returning the
// OfflineSpawner — a fail-closed no-op that logs and never spawns a subprocess.
// Without this branch, adding `offline` to KNOWN_AGENTS would let it fall through
// and silently wake Claude — the exact fail-open bug this guards against.
