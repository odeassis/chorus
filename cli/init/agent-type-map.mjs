// cli/init/agent-type-map.mjs
// The single translation between a `chorus init` adapter selection id (see
// cli/init/adapters.mjs — "claude" | "codex" | "kiro" | "opencode" | "openclaw" |
// "pi" | "dsh") and the daemon's agentType vocabulary (cli/daemon-agent.mjs
// KNOWN_AGENTS). It lives in ONE place so the credential-seed step (which writes
// each selected agent's daemon.json agents[] entry) and the daemon-setup step
// (which gates auto-start on whether any selected agent is wakeable) can never
// disagree about how a selection maps to a backend.
//
// Two rules the callers rely on:
//   1. The init id "claude" is NOT the daemon agentType — it renames to
//      "claude-code" EXPLICITLY here. No caller ever passes the raw init id
//      through to daemon.json; every write goes through agentTypeForSelection.
//   2. Any selection the daemon cannot wake as a first-class backend
//      (opencode / openclaw, and dsh while its harness is dormant/offline)
//      maps to the non-wakeable "offline" classification. Its key is still parked
//      in agents[] for the `chorus mcp` proxy, but the daemon builds no spawner
//      and dispatches no wake (spawner-select.mjs fail-closes on "offline").
//
// Fail-closed by default: an unknown / unmapped id maps to "offline" rather than a
// wakeable backend, so a future adapter added without a mapping is never silently
// woken as claude-code.

/**
 * Selection id → daemon agentType. claude/codex/kiro/pi are wakeable backends;
