// cli/wake-queue.mjs
// Per-key FIFO scheduler with a global concurrency cap, coalescing same-key
// wakes into batches. This is what makes the idea_root session anchor safe
// (cli-daemon spec "Per-root-idea wake serialization", design.md "Concurrency
// model") AND implements daemon-wake-coalescing (design.md §C1):
//   • within one key (root idea) → strictly serial, FIFO. The next batch waits
//     for the current runBatch to settle, so we never run two
//     `claude --resume <sameSessionId>` against one session.
//   • coalescing: when a key's slot frees, the ENTIRE pending array for that key
//     is drained (splice) and delivered to runBatch ONCE as a single batch. So
//     N events that pile up while the previous turn runs become ONE turn.
//     Natural batching only — NO debounce/collect timer, NO batch-size cap.
//   • across keys → concurrent, bounded by maxConcurrency.
//   • enqueue() returns immediately — never blocks the SSE loop.
//   • a batch whose runBatch throws is logged and the next batch for that key
//     proceeds (a poisoned wake must not wedge the key's queue forever).
// The queue carries opaque DATA items (the router passes `{ notification,
// attribution }`); it never introspects them — the runBatch callback (supplied
// at construction, wired to waker.wakeBatch in daemon.mjs) does.
// Plain ESM, zero deps, in-memory.
