// event-router wake messages. The spawned Claude is headless and acts only
// through the chorus_* MCP tools — these prompts tell it what happened and
// which tools to use.
//
// HEADLESS GUARD (add-daemon-headless-interaction-guard): a daemon-woken session
// has NO human at the terminal, so it must never call AskUserQuestion or any
// blocking terminal prompt — that would hang or be silently dropped. buildPrompt
// prepends HEADLESS_PREAMBLE (below) to EVERY non-null wake body so the rule rides
// every turn, new or --resume (the daemon rebuilds the prompt on each wake, so a
// per-turn prefix persists across resumes without touching the spawn argv — there
// is deliberately no --append-system-prompt; see claude-spawner.mjs). The preamble
// also names the CHORUS_DAEMON_HEADLESS=1 env signal the spawner sets.

 * key; while a turn runs, later same-key wakes pile up and — when the slot frees — are
 * drained together into a single `claude --resume` turn. This composes their one prompt.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - **Size 1** → delegate to `buildPrompt(n)` verbatim, so the single-event path is
 *    BYTE-IDENTICAL to today (and all current prompt tests keep passing). This is keyed on
 *    the count of RENDERABLE events (non-null body): a batch that reduces to a single
 *    renderable event — e.g. a real wake plus an empty `human_instruction` — also takes
 *    the single-event path.
 *  - **Size > 1 renderable** → `HEADLESS_PREAMBLE` ONCE (it is a per-turn guard, paid once
 *    per turn, not per event), then a short backlog preamble, then one labeled block per
 *    event in ARRIVAL order, each block being the reused per-action `buildPromptBody(n)` so
 *    every event keeps its own tool hints and @mention guidance.
 *  - **Same-entity collapse (Q2)**: events sharing `(action, entityUuid)` collapse into one
 *    block at the group's FIRST-SEEN position, noting the occurrence count and showing the
 *    NEWEST message. This is safe only because such actions' full content is re-derivable
 *    server-side (comments via chorus_get_comments, task lifecycle via chorus_get_*).
 *  - **`human_instruction` is NEVER collapsed (Q3, Round-1 BLOCKER-2)**: every queued chat
 *    message carries `action=human_instruction` and `entityUuid=directIdeaUuid`, and its
 *    text lives ONLY on the turn/notification (not re-fetchable), so collapsing to
 *    newest-only would silently drop earlier chat and defeat the feature. Each renders its
 *    full body as its own block, in arrival order.
 *  - Events whose body is null (empty `human_instruction`, non-wake action) are omitted; a
 *    batch with no renderable event returns null (the router then spawns nothing).
