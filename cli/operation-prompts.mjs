/**
 * Compose the conversational-idea wake instruction (template v2 — the REVIEWED CONTRACT
 * between the conversational create-idea entry and the woken daemon agent, superseding
 * the client-side create→claim template of add-conversational-idea-entry).
 *
 * The idea is PRE-CREATED and already instance-assigned + elaborating, so both templates
 * direct EDIT (never create, never claim — a claim would fail on the existing assignee).
 *  - `elaborate` (default): edit → optional research → elaboration → panel guidance → end turn.
 *  - `decompose`: edit the CONTAINER → keep isContainer → one lightweight scope-clarifying
 *    elaboration → propose candidate CHILDREN as a structured elaboration round (one
 *    single-select question per child, ≤15/round, never a multi-select) → end turn → on the
 *    confirm re-wake create each accepted child via chorus_pm_create_idea with
 *    parentUuid=<container>, children starting `open`, no auto-elaboration; the container's
 *    own status stays `elaborated`. The confirm re-wake rides the EXISTING
 *    `elaboration_answered` wake — no new wake/notification action is introduced.
 *
 * English (agent-facing, matching cli/prompts.mjs precedent); the user's description
 * passes through VERBATIM under the delimiter. Exported for unit tests: the template's
 * wording is code, and any change is a review-visible diff.
 * @param {{ideaUuid: string, projectUuid: string, projectName?: string|null,
 *   descriptionText: string, mode?: 'elaborate'|'decompose', researchFirst?: boolean}} params
