// cli/waker.mjs
// Executes a single wake: resolve the event to its idea attribution, derive the
// deterministic session id (= the DIRECT idea uuid), build the --mcp-config, spawn
// the configured headless agent, and
// fire the (no-op) upload hooks. The WakeQueue schedules these per DIRECT idea so
// two wakes for the same idea never run concurrently against the same session.
//
// TWO-ID CONTRACT (do not conflate): the session is anchored on the DIRECT idea
// (so a human can `claude --resume <idea-uuid>`), while the execution snapshot
// reports the ROOT idea (for the observability UI). Both ids come from one lineage
// resolution and are threaded SEPARATELY — the root reported in the snapshot is
// the server-resolved root, NEVER re-derived from the (direct-idea) serialization
// key.
//
// Module contract (design.md): Waker.wakeBatch(notifications, key, attribution) →
// Promise<void> runs ONE coalesced turn for a batch of same-session notifications
// (add-daemon-wake-coalescing); Waker.wake(n, key, attribution) is a thin wrapper =
// wakeBatch([n], ...) so a batch of one is byte-identical to the pre-coalescing single
// wake. A failure is logged and swallowed — it must never crash the daemon
// (no-silent-errors: visible log, no throw).
