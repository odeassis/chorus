  /**
   * Re-dispatch a DIRECTED autonomous pending turn (mentioned / task_assigned /
   * elaboration_verified) delivered by the `deliver_turn` ping (T2 — fix-pinned-wake-
   * directed-delivery). Unlike `human_instruction`, the turn carries `promptText = null`,
   * so the wake prompt must be rebuilt from the wake NOTIFICATION — `buildPrompt` (run
   * inside `waker.wake`) needs `entityType` / `entityUuid` / `entityTitle` / `actorName` /
   * `message`, none of which live on the turn. We re-read the unread notifications (the
   * same `chorus_get_notifications` the router already uses) and pick the wake notification
   * for THIS turn's session + trigger.
   *
   * PROMPT-CONTEXT CONSTRAINT (Tech Design): in the normal live case the target is online,
   * so it ALSO received the broadcast — which `#fetchAndRoute` already woke (and marked the
   * notification `seen`). This path then finds that notification already `seen` and dedups
   * away → exactly one wake. In the rare missed-broadcast case (the ping arrived but the
   * broadcast copy did not), this path is the one that wakes, with the prompt rebuilt from
   * the re-read notification. If no matching unread notification exists at all (e.g. it was
   * already read), there is no autonomous context to rebuild — log and skip (the durable
   * net is the reconnect notification backfill, which re-derives autonomous wakes).
   *
   * DEDUP across the two routes: this matched notification's `uuid` is the SAME key the
   * broadcast path marks in the shared `seen` set, so whichever route runs first claims it
   * and the other is dropped. The `turn:{uuid}` key was already marked by the caller.
