## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Interactive `chorus init` command

Chorus SHALL provide a client-mode `chorus init` subcommand, dispatched alongside `daemon` and `login`, that detects the machine's coding agents, lets the user choose which to configure, and runs the ordered configuration steps against the chosen agents. Running `chorus init --help` MUST print usage without starting the server or any configuration side effect.

#### Scenario: Interactive run configures selected agents
- **WHEN** a user runs `chorus init` in a TTY
- **THEN** the command detects agents, presents a selection with detected agents pre-checked, and after confirmation runs the configuration steps only for the selected agents, ending with a per-agent status summary

#### Scenario: Help does nothing else
- **WHEN** a user runs `chorus init --help`
- **THEN** usage text is printed and the process exits 0 without detecting, prompting, writing files, or launching the server

### Requirement: Agent detection with dual signal and always-selectable list

The command SHALL detect each supported agent using two signals — its CLI binary on `PATH` and its config directory presence — and treat an agent as detected when either signal holds. Detection MUST only drive the default pre-selection and status hints; an undetected agent MUST remain selectable so a user can configure it anyway.

#### Scenario: Detected agent is pre-selected
- **WHEN** an agent's binary is on `PATH` or its config directory exists
- **THEN** that agent is marked detected and pre-checked in the selection

#### Scenario: Undetected agent is still selectable
- **WHEN** an agent is neither on `PATH` nor has a config directory
- **THEN** it appears unchecked but selectable, and choosing it proceeds to configure it

### Requirement: One-time credential seeding into centralized daemon config

The command SHALL collect the Chorus URL and API key exactly once per run and persist them to the centralized daemon configuration (`~/.chorus/daemon.json`), reusing the existing login/credential modules. It MUST NOT write the API key into any per-agent configuration. The write MUST merge into existing daemon configuration without clobbering unrelated fields.

#### Scenario: Credentials captured once and centralized
- **WHEN** a user supplies a valid Chorus URL and API key (via prompt or `--url`/`--api-key`)
- **THEN** the values are validated and written once to `~/.chorus/daemon.json`, and no per-agent config file receives the API key

#### Scenario: Existing daemon config is preserved
- **WHEN** `~/.chorus/daemon.json` already contains unrelated fields such as prior credentials or acknowledgement timestamps
- **THEN** seeding updates only the connection fields and leaves the unrelated fields intact

### Requirement: Idempotent re-run with per-agent diff and backup

Re-running `chorus init` SHALL be idempotent: it reads each selected agent's current Chorus install state, reports per-agent status, applies only the missing or repair delta, and backs up any config file before overwriting it. A second run against an already-configured agent MUST report it as already configured and make no destructive change.

#### Scenario: Second run is a no-op for a configured agent
- **WHEN** an agent already has the Chorus plugin installed and enabled
- **THEN** the re-run reports it as `skipped (already configured)` and does not rewrite its config

#### Scenario: Backup before overwrite
- **WHEN** a step must overwrite an existing agent config file
- **THEN** the original is copied to a `.chorus-bak` backup before the new content is written

### Requirement: Scriptable non-interactive surface

The command SHALL support non-interactive use via `--agents <csv>`, `--all`, `--yes`, `--url`, and `--api-key`. When stdin or stdout is not a TTY, the command MUST require an explicit `--agents` or `--all` and abort with a clear message otherwise, rather than guessing which agents to configure. An unknown value in `--agents` MUST be a hard error that lists the valid agent ids.

#### Scenario: CI run with explicit agents
- **WHEN** `chorus init --agents claude,codex --url <u> --api-key <k> --yes` runs in a non-TTY environment
- **THEN** it configures exactly Claude Code and Codex without prompting

#### Scenario: Non-TTY without a selection aborts
- **WHEN** `chorus init` runs in a non-TTY environment with neither `--agents` nor `--all`
- **THEN** it aborts with a message instructing the caller to pass `--agents` or `--all`, and configures nothing

#### Scenario: Unknown agent id is rejected
- **WHEN** `--agents` contains an id not in the adapter registry
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero and lists the valid agent ids

### Requirement: Pluggable step-orchestration seam

The command SHALL run configuration through an ordered, extensible step registry rather than a hard-coded pipeline. Each step declares an order and a scope (`once` or `per-agent`). This change SHALL register the credential-seed step and the plugin-install step; sibling capabilities MUST be able to register additional steps (MCP proxy, daemon setup) without modifying the command core.

#### Scenario: Steps run in declared order
- **WHEN** `chorus init` executes
- **THEN** registered steps run in ascending order, `once`-scoped steps run a single time and `per-agent` steps run once per selected agent

#### Scenario: A new step is added without core changes
- **WHEN** a sibling registers an additional step into the registry
- **THEN** it participates in the ordered run with no edit to the command's orchestration core
