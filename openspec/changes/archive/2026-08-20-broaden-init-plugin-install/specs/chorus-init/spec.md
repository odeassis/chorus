## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Optional daemon auto-start step in `chorus init`

`chorus init` SHALL run a `once`-scoped daemon-setup step, ordered after the
credential-seed and plugin-install steps, that configures the local Chorus daemon
and optionally installs it as a boot-autostart service. The step SHALL reuse the
existing `chorus daemon install` preflight to resolve and persist the served
working-directory set (`cwds`) and the backend agent set into `~/.chorus/daemon.json`
(credentials are already seeded by the credential-seed step). The step SHALL NOT
collect or persist model-provider secrets (e.g. `AWS_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*`, Bedrock) —
the centralized credential model is connection-only (Chorus URL + API key), and no
per-agent secret injection is introduced.

**Capability gate (all-offline).** The auto-start prompt and the boot-service install
SHALL run only when at least one selected agent is daemon-wakeable. When every selected
agent is offline (no daemon-wakeable backend) there is nothing for the daemon to wake,
so the step SHALL persist the `agents[]` entries, skip the auto-start prompt and the
service install entirely (regardless of `--daemon-autostart`), and report that no
daemon-wakeable agent was selected.

The step SHALL offer the auto-start install **only** on a platform whose auto-start
capability is supported (Linux systemd or macOS launchd). On an unsupported
platform it SHALL still persist `~/.chorus/daemon.json` and print the manual start
command, and SHALL NOT attempt to install a service.

In an interactive run (a TTY without `--yes`) with at least one daemon-wakeable agent
selected, the step SHALL prompt whether to install and enable the daemon to auto-start
on boot, **defaulting to No** (opt-in), and SHALL install only on an affirmative answer.
In a non-interactive run (non-TTY, or `--yes`) the step SHALL install the boot service
only when an explicit `--daemon-autostart` flag is passed AND at least one selected agent
is daemon-wakeable; otherwise it SHALL persist `~/.chorus/daemon.json` and skip the
service install without guessing.

Before installing a boot service, the step SHALL run the same credential
validate-or-abort guarantee as `chorus daemon install`: resolve credentials from
the layered source, validate the key against the server, and persist the
url + key + identity into `~/.chorus/daemon.json`. If credentials cannot be resolved
or the key fails validation, the step SHALL install nothing and report a failure —
it SHALL NOT rely solely on the earlier credential-seed step, and SHALL never
install a boot service that would fail authentication and restart-loop at boot.

When the user opts in on a supported platform, the step SHALL install **and enable**
the boot service so the daemon starts immediately and at every boot (delegating to
the same install path as `chorus daemon install`). The step SHALL be idempotent:
when a boot service is already installed for the platform it SHALL report the
daemon as already configured and make no destructive rewrite, applying only a
missing/drifted delta as a repair. A failed install SHALL be reported visibly with
its underlying error (non-zero outcome), never a silent skip.

#### Scenario: Interactive run offers opt-in auto-start defaulting to No
- **WHEN** a user runs `chorus init` in a TTY on a platform that supports auto-start (Linux systemd or macOS launchd) with at least one daemon-wakeable agent selected
- **THEN** the daemon-setup step persists the served cwds and backend to `~/.chorus/daemon.json`, prompts whether to auto-start the daemon on boot with a default of No, and installs & enables the boot service only if the user affirmatively accepts

#### Scenario: All selected agents are offline skips the prompt and install
- **WHEN** a user runs `chorus init` in a TTY on a supported platform but every selected agent is offline (no daemon-wakeable backend)
- **THEN** the step persists the `agents[]` entries, skips the auto-start prompt and the service install entirely, and reports that no daemon-wakeable agent was selected

#### Scenario: Declining auto-start still writes daemon config
- **WHEN** a user runs `chorus init` in a TTY and declines the auto-start prompt
- **THEN** `~/.chorus/daemon.json` is written (credentials, cwds, backend) and the step prints the manual `chorus daemon` start command without installing any service

#### Scenario: Non-interactive run requires an explicit flag to install
- **WHEN** `chorus init` runs in a non-TTY environment, or with `--yes` in a TTY, WITHOUT `--daemon-autostart`, and at least one selected agent is daemon-wakeable
- **THEN** the step persists `~/.chorus/daemon.json` and skips the boot-service install, reporting that `--daemon-autostart` is required to install the service, and does not block on a prompt

#### Scenario: Auto-start install aborts on unvalidated credentials
- **WHEN** the daemon-setup step decides to install (opt-in or `--daemon-autostart`) but the resolved Chorus key fails server validation, or no credentials resolve
- **THEN** the step installs no service and reports a failure, rather than installing a boot service that would fail authentication at boot

#### Scenario: Non-interactive run with the flag installs the service
- **WHEN** `chorus init --daemon-autostart` runs in a non-TTY environment on a supported platform with resolvable credentials and at least one daemon-wakeable agent selected
- **THEN** the step installs and enables the boot service without prompting

#### Scenario: Unsupported platform skips the service and prints manual steps
- **WHEN** `chorus init` runs on a platform whose auto-start capability is unsupported (e.g. Windows)
- **THEN** the step persists `~/.chorus/daemon.json`, prints the manual start steps, and does not attempt to install a boot service, regardless of `--daemon-autostart`

#### Scenario: Re-run is idempotent when the service is already installed
- **WHEN** a user re-runs `chorus init` (opting in, or with `--daemon-autostart`) on a machine where the boot service is already installed
- **THEN** the step reports the daemon as already configured for auto-start and makes no destructive rewrite, repairing only if a drift is detected

#### Scenario: The step never collects provider secrets
- **WHEN** the daemon-setup step runs in any mode
- **THEN** it collects only the Chorus connection credentials and the daemon's cwds/backend, and never prompts for or persists model-provider secrets into `~/.chorus/daemon.json` or any service unit

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-selected-agent credential seeding into centralized daemon config

The command SHALL seed Chorus credentials into the centralized daemon configuration (`~/.chorus/daemon.json`), capturing **one Chorus API key per selected agent** and writing each as its own `agents[]` entry carrying that agent's `agentType`. Each selected agent's key MUST be validated against the server before it is persisted. The command MUST NOT write any API key into a coding-agent's own configuration file (e.g. `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`) — the per-agent keys live only in the centralized `daemon.json`. Writes MUST merge into existing daemon configuration without clobbering unrelated fields, and the key MUST be written 0600 and never echoed to output.

On a TTY the command captures a key per selected agent (accepting `--api-key`/`CHORUS_API_KEY` as a pre-fill for the first, and prompting for the rest). In a non-interactive run a supplied `--api-key` applies to the selected agent(s); when multiple selected agents need distinct keys and none can be prompted, the command MUST report which agents still need a key rather than silently reusing one.

#### Scenario: A key is captured and validated per selected agent
- **WHEN** a user selects multiple agents and supplies a valid Chorus key for each (prompt or flag/env)
- **THEN** each key is validated and written as its own `agents[]` entry in `~/.chorus/daemon.json` with that agent's `agentType`, and no coding-agent's own config file receives any key

#### Scenario: Existing daemon config is preserved
- **WHEN** `~/.chorus/daemon.json` already contains unrelated fields (prior agents, acknowledgement timestamps)
- **THEN** seeding updates only the connection/agents fields for the selected agents and leaves unrelated fields intact

#### Scenario: Key never echoed
- **WHEN** a key is captured or written
- **THEN** it is written with 0600 permissions and never printed to stdout/stderr or logs

### Requirement: Daemon backend agentType derived from the init selection, not re-prompted

The daemon-setup step SHALL derive each agent's `daemon.json` backend `agentType` from the agents already chosen in the `chorus init` selection step, and SHALL NOT render a separate "which agent backend?" selection prompt. The step-1 selection is the single point at which the agent set is chosen; the credential-seed and daemon-setup steps consume that same selection.

The mapping from an init selection id to a `daemon.json` `agentType` SHALL be explicit and total: the init id `claude` maps to `agentType: "claude-code"`; `codex` → `codex`; `kiro` → `kiro`; and any selected agent whose backend is not daemon-wakeable (`opencode`, `openclaw`, `pi`, and `dsh` while its daemon backend is de-advertised) maps to `agentType: "offline"`. The mapping MUST NOT pass an init id through verbatim when it differs from the daemon backend name (notably `claude` ≠ `claude-code`).

#### Scenario: No second backend prompt
- **WHEN** `chorus init` proceeds from agent selection into the daemon-setup step on a TTY
- **THEN** the step derives each agent's `agentType` from the selection and does not display an agent-backend menu again

#### Scenario: claude selection maps to the claude-code agentType
- **WHEN** the init selection includes the `claude` adapter id
- **THEN** its `agents[]` entry records `agentType: "claude-code"` (not `claude`), matching the daemon's `KNOWN_AGENTS` vocabulary

#### Scenario: Non-wakeable selection maps to offline
- **WHEN** the init selection includes an agent with no daemon-wakeable backend (e.g. `opencode` or `pi`)
- **THEN** its `agents[]` entry records `agentType: "offline"`

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: One-time credential seeding into centralized daemon config

(Replaced by "Per-selected-agent credential seeding into centralized daemon config" above — the single-key model becomes one Chorus key per selected agent.)
