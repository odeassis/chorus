# daemon-interrupt-resume Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change daemon-interrupt-resume. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Control commands SHALL travel a reverse channel that is distinct from the wake path

The system SHALL provide a server→daemon control channel that reuses the existing
notification SSE transport but is NOT the wake path. A control command SHALL be delivered as
a dedicated SSE event whose `type` is `control` (not a persisted `Notification`), and the
daemon SHALL route it to a control handler WITHOUT enqueuing any wake. The control command
action SHALL NOT be a member of the daemon's `WAKE_ACTIONS` set, and receiving a control
event SHALL NOT spawn a new Claude subprocess. The server-side publish step SHALL be hidden
behind a single control-dispatch function so a future dedicated bidirectional channel can
replace the transport without changing callers.

#### Scenario: A control event does not produce a wake

- **WHEN** the daemon receives an SSE event with `type = "control"`
- **THEN** it MUST route the event to its control handler
- **AND** it MUST NOT enqueue anything on the WakeQueue or spawn a new subprocess

#### Scenario: Control commands are not persisted notifications

- **WHEN** an interrupt is issued
- **THEN** the delivered control event MUST NOT be created as a `Notification` row
- **AND** its action MUST NOT appear in `WAKE_ACTIONS`

#### Scenario: The transport is isolated behind a dispatch seam

- **WHEN** the control endpoint publishes a command
- **THEN** it MUST do so through a single control-dispatch function that encapsulates the
  notification-stream transport, so the transport can be swapped without changing the
  endpoint or its callers

### Requirement: The server SHALL expose an agent/user-callable endpoint that issues a daemon control command

The server SHALL expose `POST /api/daemon/control` that accepts a control command targeting a
specific daemon connection: `{ command, targetConnectionUuid, entityType, entityUuid }`. The
endpoint SHALL require authentication, SHALL NOT be implemented as an MCP tool, and SHALL NOT
introduce a new permission bit. It SHALL use the standard API envelope. The endpoint SHALL
validate the request body and SHALL reject an unknown `command`. On success it SHALL publish
the control event to the target connection and return without waiting for the kill to
complete; the resulting task state transition SHALL be reported asynchronously by the daemon.

#### Scenario: An unauthenticated control request is rejected

- **GIVEN** a request to `POST /api/daemon/control` with no valid auth
- **WHEN** the server handles it
- **THEN** the response status MUST be 401 and no control event MUST be published

#### Scenario: A well-formed interrupt is accepted and published

- **GIVEN** an authorized caller and a `targetConnectionUuid` that exists in the caller's company
- **WHEN** the caller POSTs `{ command: "interrupt", targetConnectionUuid, entityType, entityUuid }`
- **THEN** the response MUST be the standard success envelope
- **AND** a control event for that connection MUST be published on the event bus

#### Scenario: An unknown command is rejected

- **WHEN** the caller POSTs a `command` outside the accepted set
- **THEN** the server MUST reject the request with a client error and publish nothing

### Requirement: Only the daemon agent's owner or a task:admin caller SHALL be authorized to interrupt

The control endpoint SHALL authorize the caller against the agent that owns the target
connection: it SHALL resolve `targetConnectionUuid` to its `DaemonConnection` within the
caller's company, resolve that connection's agent and the agent's owner, and SHALL allow the
command only when the caller is that owner OR the caller holds `task:admin`. A connection that
does not exist within the caller's company SHALL yield a not-found response that does not
reveal another company's or another owner's connection. A caller who is neither the owner nor
a `task:admin` SHALL be forbidden. Authorization SHALL NOT cross company boundaries.

#### Scenario: The owner may interrupt their agent's subprocess

- **GIVEN** user U owns the agent behind connection C
- **WHEN** U issues an interrupt targeting C
- **THEN** the command MUST be authorized and published

#### Scenario: A task:admin may interrupt

- **GIVEN** a caller holding `task:admin` in the same company as connection C
- **WHEN** the caller issues an interrupt targeting C
- **THEN** the command MUST be authorized

#### Scenario: A non-owner without task:admin is forbidden

- **GIVEN** a caller who neither owns the agent behind connection C nor holds `task:admin`
- **WHEN** the caller issues an interrupt targeting C
- **THEN** the response MUST be 403 and no control event MUST be published

#### Scenario: Targeting another company's connection does not disclose it

- **GIVEN** connection C belongs to an agent in a different company
- **WHEN** a caller issues an interrupt naming `targetConnectionUuid = C`
- **THEN** the response MUST be a not-found that does not confirm C exists
- **AND** no control event MUST be published

### Requirement: The control event SHALL be delivered to the targeted connection and verified twice on the daemon

The control event SHALL be keyed per connection (`control:{connectionUuid}`) so it reaches
only the daemon stream holding that connection, not every connection of the agent. The
daemon's SSE route SHALL subscribe the per-connection handler to this key (only for a
registered daemon connection) and tear it down on disconnect. The daemon SHALL act on a
control command only when BOTH hold: the event's `targetConnectionUuid` equals the daemon's
own registered connection uuid, AND the daemon's in-memory execution registry confirms it
currently holds a running subprocess for the command's `{entityType, entityUuid}`. If either
check fails, the daemon SHALL ignore the command (logged, no action), so a stale or recycled
connection uuid can never cause the wrong subprocess to be killed.

#### Scenario: Both checks pass — the command acts

- **GIVEN** a daemon registered as connection C currently running a subprocess for entity E
- **WHEN** it receives a control event with `targetConnectionUuid = C` and entity E
- **THEN** it MUST proceed to interrupt that subprocess

#### Scenario: Connection-uuid mismatch is ignored

- **GIVEN** a daemon registered as connection C
- **WHEN** it receives a control event whose `targetConnectionUuid` is not C
- **THEN** it MUST ignore the command and MUST NOT touch any subprocess

#### Scenario: Entity not held is ignored

- **GIVEN** a daemon registered as connection C with no running subprocess for entity E
- **WHEN** it receives a control event for `targetConnectionUuid = C` and entity E
- **THEN** it MUST ignore the command (logged) and MUST NOT kill an unrelated subprocess

#### Scenario: The control subscription is removed on disconnect

- **WHEN** a daemon connection's stream aborts
- **THEN** its `control:{connectionUuid}` subscription MUST be torn down alongside its
  notification subscription

### Requirement: The daemon SHALL map an interrupt target to its running subprocess via the execution registry

The daemon SHALL resolve a control command's `{entityType, entityUuid}` to the concrete
running subprocess by extending the existing in-memory execution registry (the same
`entityType:entityUuid`-keyed map that produces the execution snapshot) to also hold the live
child process handle for a running wake. The uploaded execution snapshot SHALL continue to
carry only its serializable fields and SHALL NOT include the child handle. A queued (not yet
running) entry SHALL carry no child handle.

#### Scenario: An interrupt resolves to the running child via the registry

- **GIVEN** a wake for entity E is running and its registry entry holds the child handle
- **WHEN** an authorized interrupt for E is verified
- **THEN** the daemon MUST obtain the child handle from the registry entry for E and target it

#### Scenario: The child handle never leaks into the snapshot

- **WHEN** the daemon builds an execution snapshot for upload
- **THEN** the snapshot entries MUST contain only the serializable execution fields
- **AND** MUST NOT contain the child process handle

### Requirement: Interrupting SHALL use a two-stage stop with a configurable timeout

On interrupt the daemon SHALL first attempt a graceful stop by sending `SIGINT` to the
running subprocess, giving it the opportunity to flush in-progress work, and SHALL escalate to
a forceful kill only if the subprocess has not exited within a configurable timeout. The
timeout SHALL default to 10 seconds and SHALL be resolvable through the daemon's layered
configuration (command-line flag, then the `CHORUS_DAEMON_SIGINT_TIMEOUT` environment
variable, then `~/.chorus/daemon.json`, then the default), consistent with the daemon's
existing layered resolution style. The kill procedure SHALL never throw into the wake path and
SHALL log its actions visibly.

#### Scenario: Graceful stop within the timeout

- **GIVEN** a running subprocess that exits after receiving `SIGINT` before the timeout
- **WHEN** an interrupt is processed
- **THEN** the daemon MUST send `SIGINT`, observe the exit, and NOT escalate to a forceful kill

#### Scenario: Escalation after the timeout

- **GIVEN** a running subprocess that does not exit within the configured timeout after `SIGINT`
- **WHEN** the timeout elapses
- **THEN** the daemon MUST escalate to a forceful kill of the subprocess

#### Scenario: The timeout is configurable with layered precedence

- **WHEN** the SIGINT-escalation timeout is resolved
- **THEN** a command-line flag MUST override the environment variable, which MUST override the
  config file, which MUST override the built-in default of 10 seconds

### Requirement: The forceful kill SHALL terminate the whole process tree cross-platform without native dependencies

The daemon SHALL terminate the entire subprocess tree (the spawned Claude and any
grandchildren it spawned), not only the direct child pid, using only platform commands and
Node built-ins — no npm package with native bindings. On POSIX the daemon SHALL spawn the
subprocess in its own process group (detached) and signal the group, so a group kill reaches
descendants. On Windows the daemon SHALL terminate the tree via the platform `taskkill`
facility targeting the pid with tree and force flags. Spawning in a process group SHALL NOT
change prompt delivery over stdin or the parsing of the subprocess's stream-json output.

#### Scenario: POSIX group kill reaches descendants

- **GIVEN** a POSIX daemon whose subprocess was spawned in its own process group and spawned a grandchild
- **WHEN** the daemon forcefully kills the subprocess
- **THEN** it MUST signal the process group so the grandchild is also terminated, leaving no orphan

#### Scenario: Windows terminates the tree via taskkill

- **GIVEN** a Windows daemon running a subprocess tree
- **WHEN** the daemon forcefully kills it
- **THEN** it MUST terminate the whole tree by pid using the platform tree-and-force termination, without a native-binding dependency

#### Scenario: Process-group spawn does not regress IO

- **WHEN** the subprocess is spawned in its own process group on POSIX
- **THEN** the prompt MUST still be delivered over stdin and the stream-json output MUST still parse line by line

### Requirement: The execution row SHALL carry an interrupted state distinguishing user interrupts from crashes

The interrupted state SHALL live on the daemon EXECUTION record (`DaemonExecution`, keyed by
connection + entity), NOT on the `Task` model — because the daemon executes task, idea,
proposal, and document wakes, so interruption is an execution-lifecycle fact that MUST apply to
any wake-triggering resource, not only tasks. The `DaemonExecution` model SHALL support an
`interrupted` status and SHALL carry an `interruptedReason` that is `user` when an authorized
user requested the interrupt and `crash` when the subprocess exited unexpectedly without an
interrupt request. Both causes SHALL share the single `interrupted` status, distinguished only
by `interruptedReason`. The `Task` model SHALL NOT gain an interrupted status or reason field.
The new field SHALL be delivered by a Prisma-CLI-generated migration containing only DDL (no
data backfill).

`interrupted` SHALL be a STICKY status: snapshot reconcile and offline reconcile (which transition
`running`/`queued` rows to `ended` when no longer justified) SHALL NOT transition an `interrupted`
row to `ended` — so an interrupted, resumable row keeps showing after the killed subprocess drops
out of the daemon's next snapshot. The reason SHALL be cleared (back to null, status back to
`running`) only when a resume re-dispatch reports the entity active again.

#### Scenario: A user interrupt marks the execution row interrupted with reason user

- **GIVEN** a running execution row for an entity whose subprocess is interrupted on an authorized user request
- **WHEN** the daemon reports the outcome
- **THEN** that connection+entity execution row's status MUST become `interrupted` with `interruptedReason = "user"`

#### Scenario: A crash marks the execution row interrupted with reason crash

- **GIVEN** a running execution row whose subprocess exits unexpectedly with no interrupt requested
- **WHEN** the daemon reports the outcome
- **THEN** the execution row status MUST become `interrupted` with `interruptedReason = "crash"`

#### Scenario: An interrupted row is sticky across reconcile

- **GIVEN** an `interrupted` execution row that is absent from the daemon's next snapshot
- **WHEN** snapshot reconcile (or offline reconcile) runs
- **THEN** the row MUST remain `interrupted` and MUST NOT be transitioned to `ended`

#### Scenario: Interruption applies to a non-task wake

- **GIVEN** a running execution row whose entity is an idea (an @-mention/elaboration wake)
- **WHEN** its subprocess is interrupted
- **THEN** the idea's execution row MUST become `interrupted` — the interrupted state is not task-only

#### Scenario: The Task model is unchanged

- **WHEN** the schema change is implemented
- **THEN** the `Task` model MUST NOT gain an `interrupted` status value or an `interruptedReason` field
- **AND** the generated migration MUST contain only schema DDL and MUST NOT contain data backfill statements

### Requirement: A server endpoint SHALL resume a user-interrupted execution via the control channel

The server SHALL expose `POST /api/daemon/resume` (keyed by `connectionUuid` + entity, the same
daemon surface as interrupt — NOT a Task-level endpoint) that resumes an interrupted
execution. It SHALL require the execution row to be `interrupted` with `interruptedReason`
equal to `"user"` OR `"crash"`, and SHALL reject any row that is not (a `running`, `queued`,
or `ended` row is not resumable). It SHALL authorize the caller with the same rule as
interrupt (the connection agent's owner or a `task:admin` caller; a connection absent within
the caller's company → 404 non-disclosure). On success it SHALL transition the row
`interrupted → running` (clearing `interruptedReason`) and SHALL dispatch a `resume` control
command on the reverse control channel to the holding connection, carrying the row's PRIOR
`interruptedReason` as a `resumeReason` field so the daemon can distinguish a crash resume
from a user resume. The daemon SHALL re-dispatch the wake for that entity, continuing the
existing session (Claude Code via `claude --resume <directIdeaUuid>`, codex via its persisted
thread-id mapping — the resume path SHALL be spawner-agnostic). Resume SHALL be
entity-generic (task / idea / proposal / document / daemon_session).

#### Scenario: Resuming a user-interrupted execution re-dispatches it

- **GIVEN** an execution row that is `interrupted` with `interruptedReason = "user"`
- **WHEN** an authorized caller POSTs to `/api/daemon/resume` with that connection + entity
- **THEN** the row MUST transition to `running` with `interruptedReason` cleared
- **AND** a `resume` control command with `resumeReason = "user"` MUST be dispatched to the holding connection

#### Scenario: Resuming a crash-interrupted execution re-dispatches it

- **GIVEN** an execution row that is `interrupted` with `interruptedReason = "crash"`
- **WHEN** an authorized caller POSTs to `/api/daemon/resume` with that connection + entity
- **THEN** the row MUST transition to `running` with `interruptedReason` cleared
- **AND** a `resume` control command with `resumeReason = "crash"` MUST be dispatched to the holding connection

#### Scenario: A non-interrupted execution is not resumable

- **GIVEN** an execution row whose status is `running`, `queued`, or `ended`
- **WHEN** a caller POSTs to `/api/daemon/resume`
- **THEN** the request MUST be rejected and no `resume` control command MUST be dispatched

#### Scenario: Resume to an offline daemon is refused, leaving the row resumable

- **GIVEN** an `interrupted` execution row (either reason) whose daemon connection is effectively offline
- **WHEN** an authorized caller POSTs to `/api/daemon/resume`
- **THEN** the request MUST be rejected (the transient `resume` control event would otherwise be dropped and silently lost), the row MUST remain `interrupted` (still resumable once the daemon reconnects), and no `resume` control command MUST be dispatched

#### Scenario: The resume control command re-enters the wake path

- **WHEN** the daemon receives a `resume` control command for an entity it is registered to hold
- **THEN** it MUST re-dispatch a wake for that entity (a synthetic `resource_resumed` wake) so the existing wake path continues the session via the active spawner's session-resume mechanism

### Requirement: Resume SHALL be driven by intent — manual for user interrupts, automatic for crashes

A user-requested interrupt SHALL be resumed only by an explicit user action: resuming
re-dispatches work for the same direct-idea session, and the daemon SHALL continue the
existing session (Claude Code `claude --resume <directIdeaUuid>`; codex via its thread-id
mapping) because the session's persisted context already exists. A user-requested interrupt
SHALL NOT be auto-resumed, so an intentional stop is never silently restarted against the
user's intent.

A crash (`interruptedReason = "crash"`) SHALL be recoverable through BOTH paths: manually,
via the same explicit resume action as a user interrupt (covering the case where the daemon
stays online after the subprocess crash, which reconnect-backfill never reaches); and
automatically, by the daemon's existing reconnect-backfill mechanism when the daemon
reconnects. A crash resume that was performed manually SHALL NOT cause the same wake to run
twice when reconnect-backfill later fires: the existing notification/turn dedup (`seen` set)
and per-session queue serialization SHALL bound duplicate delivery.

#### Scenario: A user interrupt waits for an explicit resume

- **GIVEN** an execution row that is `interrupted` with `interruptedReason = "user"`
- **WHEN** no user resume action has been taken
- **THEN** the daemon MUST NOT automatically restart the session

#### Scenario: Resuming continues the same session

- **GIVEN** a user resumes an interrupted execution whose session context (on-disk transcript or codex thread mapping) exists
- **WHEN** the wake is re-dispatched
- **THEN** the daemon MUST continue the existing session via the active spawner's resume mechanism rather than starting a new session

#### Scenario: A crash is auto-recovered on reconnect

- **GIVEN** an execution row interrupted with `interruptedReason = "crash"` and a daemon that went offline
- **WHEN** the daemon's reconnect-backfill path next runs
- **THEN** the missed wake MUST be re-fired automatically without a user action

#### Scenario: A crash while the daemon stays online is manually resumable

- **GIVEN** an execution row interrupted with `interruptedReason = "crash"` whose daemon connection remains online
- **WHEN** the user clicks the resume control
- **THEN** the session MUST be resumed via the manual resume path without waiting for a reconnect

### Requirement: The Agent Connections UI SHALL offer interrupt and resume controls

The Agent Connections detail pane AND the daemon chat window's composer action row SHALL
present an interrupt control on each running execution of a connection the viewer is
authorized to control, and a resume control on each execution row that is `interrupted` —
with `interruptedReason = "user"` OR `interruptedReason = "crash"`. A `crash`-interrupted
row SHALL additionally present a concise error indication (that the previous run exited
abnormally) alongside its resume control, and SHALL NOT claim the crash auto-recovers
without user action. Issuing an interrupt SHALL call the control endpoint, and issuing a
resume SHALL call the resume endpoint, with the connection and entity already known from the
execution-state view. The resumed run SHALL continue in the SAME conversation stream in the
chat window (crash → resume → continuation visible in one transcript). All user-facing
strings SHALL be localized in both supported locales, and the design file SHALL be updated
to reflect the new controls.

#### Scenario: Interrupt control on a running row

- **GIVEN** a viewer authorized to control connection C which is running entity E
- **WHEN** the viewer opens C's detail pane
- **THEN** the running row for E MUST present an interrupt control that issues the control command for C and E

#### Scenario: Resume control on a user-interrupted row

- **GIVEN** an execution row interrupted with `interruptedReason = "user"`
- **WHEN** the viewer views it
- **THEN** a resume control MUST be offered that calls the resume endpoint

#### Scenario: Resume control and error indication on a crash-interrupted row

- **GIVEN** an execution row interrupted with `interruptedReason = "crash"`
- **WHEN** the viewer views it in the chat composer action row or the connection detail pane
- **THEN** a resume control MUST be offered that calls the resume endpoint
- **AND** an error indication MUST be shown stating the run exited abnormally
- **AND** no static "auto-recovers" claim MUST be shown

#### Scenario: The resumed run continues the same conversation

- **GIVEN** a crash-interrupted execution resumed from the chat window
- **WHEN** the resumed run produces transcript output
- **THEN** the output MUST appear in the same conversation stream, after the failed run's records

#### Scenario: Control strings are localized

- **WHEN** the interrupt and resume controls render
- **THEN** every user-facing string MUST be present in both supported locales

### Requirement: A crash resume SHALL inject a crash-specific continue instruction into the resumed wake

The daemon SHALL build the synthetic `resource_resumed` wake prompt according to the resume
kind carried on the control event. When `resumeReason = "crash"`, the prompt SHALL be a
fixed, generated continue instruction that (1) states the previous run on this entity exited
abnormally, (2) instructs the agent to first re-check the current state (via the appropriate
`chorus_get_*` tools and inspection of any partial local work), and (3) instructs it to then
continue the unfinished work. When `resumeReason = "user"` or the field is absent (an older
server), the daemon SHALL use the existing user-resume prompt unchanged — a missing or
unknown `resumeReason` SHALL degrade gracefully and SHALL NOT fail the resume. No user input
SHALL be required to compose the crash instruction, and the instruction SHALL NOT be
persisted as a separate human-instruction turn.

#### Scenario: A crash resume wakes with the crash-specific instruction

- **GIVEN** a daemon receiving a `resume` control command with `resumeReason = "crash"`
- **WHEN** it re-dispatches the wake
- **THEN** the wake prompt MUST state the previous run exited abnormally and instruct the agent to verify current state before continuing

#### Scenario: A user resume keeps the existing prompt

- **GIVEN** a daemon receiving a `resume` control command with `resumeReason = "user"`
- **WHEN** it re-dispatches the wake
- **THEN** the wake prompt MUST be the existing user-resume continue instruction

#### Scenario: A resume without a reason degrades to the user-resume prompt

- **GIVEN** a daemon receiving a `resume` control command with no `resumeReason` field
- **WHEN** it re-dispatches the wake
- **THEN** it MUST resume successfully using the existing user-resume prompt

### Requirement: The chat SHALL let a user interrupt the idea's running turn from any thread

The daemon chat surface SHALL derive the composer's controllable (interruptible / resumable) execution for an idea-anchored conversation by matching the idea's running execution across ALL of the agent's live connection slices, not only the viewed session's `originConnectionUuid` slice. An execution matches the idea when `exec.entityType === "idea" && exec.entityUuid === ideaUuid`, OR `exec.directIdeaUuid === ideaUuid` (covering child task / proposal / document wakes whose direct idea IS this conversation's idea). The idea uuid SHALL be the viewed session's `directIdeaUuid` when present. Because the interrupt control request carries `exec.connectionUuid`, `exec.entityType`, and `exec.entityUuid` taken verbatim from the matched execution, a match found on a different connection (or belonging to a different `(agentUuid, sessionId)` conversation row for the same idea) SHALL still interrupt the correct running subprocess with no server, endpoint, permission, or schema change. The match SHALL be strictly by the DIRECT idea, never the root idea, so a sibling idea's running turn is never interrupted.

#### Scenario: Interrupt reaches the running turn after a cwd switch

- **GIVEN** an idea whose conversation is viewed on screen
- **AND** the idea's running turn executes on a different connection than the viewed session's origin
- **WHEN** the composer derives its controllable execution
- **THEN** it MUST find the idea's running execution across all connection slices
- **AND** the Interrupt control MUST render and, when pressed, MUST target that execution's own `connectionUuid` / `entityType` / `entityUuid` so the running subprocess is stopped

#### Scenario: Interrupt reaches the running turn after an agent switch

- **GIVEN** an idea reassigned from agent A to agent B, where A still has a running turn on its own `(A, idea)` conversation row
- **AND** the user is viewing agent B's conversation for the same idea
- **WHEN** the composer derives its controllable execution for the idea
- **THEN** it MUST match agent A's running `idea:<ideaUuid>` execution and expose an Interrupt control that stops it

#### Scenario: A sibling idea's running turn is never interrupted

- **GIVEN** two distinct ideas each with a running turn
- **WHEN** the composer for one idea's conversation derives its controllable execution
- **THEN** it MUST match only executions whose `entityUuid` or `directIdeaUuid` equals THIS idea's uuid
- **AND** it MUST NOT match the sibling idea's running execution

### Requirement: The per-conversation interrupt match SHALL tolerate the legacy residual per-instance session key

For fix-forward compatibility with residual per-instance sessions created before the fork was removed, when a conversation has `directIdeaUuid === null` AND its `sessionId` contains the `::` separator (the legacy `${ideaUuid}::${connectionUuid}` key), the per-conversation execution match SHALL derive the idea uuid from the `::`-prefix (`sessionId.split("::")[0]`) and match the idea's executions on that derived uuid — the same `::`-split the daemon router already uses for notification matching. A genuinely ad-hoc conversation (a random `sessionId` with no `::` and `directIdeaUuid === null`) SHALL keep the existing ad-hoc match (`exec.entityType === "daemon_session" && exec.entityUuid === sessionId`) unchanged. This heal SHALL be UI-only and SHALL NOT migrate, merge, or rewrite any DaemonSession row.

#### Scenario: A legacy residual thread regains a working interrupt

- **GIVEN** a residual conversation with `directIdeaUuid === null` and `sessionId === "<ideaUuid>::<connUuid>"`
- **AND** the idea's turn is running (reported by the daemon as `idea:<ideaUuid>`)
- **WHEN** the composer derives its controllable execution for that residual conversation
- **THEN** it MUST derive the idea uuid from the `::`-prefix and match the running `idea:<ideaUuid>` execution
- **AND** the Interrupt control MUST render and stop the running subprocess

#### Scenario: A genuinely ad-hoc conversation keeps its own match

- **GIVEN** an ad-hoc conversation whose `sessionId` is a random uuid with no `::` and `directIdeaUuid === null`
- **WHEN** the composer derives its controllable execution
- **THEN** it MUST match only its own `daemon_session:<sessionId>` execution as before, with no idea-prefix derivation

### Requirement: Deterministic Claude session conflicts receive one bounded resume fallback

When a Claude wake launched with `--session-id` returns the deterministic session-conflict classification, the daemon MUST retry that wake exactly once with `--resume` using the same session anchor, cwd, prompt, MCP configuration, and transcript callback. The retry MUST track its live child for interrupt handling without repeating the turn's pending-to-running lifecycle transition. No fallback is permitted for an unclassified failure or for a conflict returned by the fallback itself.

#### Scenario: Resume fallback succeeds

- **WHEN** a new-session Claude launch reports that its session ID is already in use and the one-time `--resume` retry exits cleanly
- **THEN** the daemon MUST complete the wake from the retry result without reporting a crash

#### Scenario: Resume fallback also fails

- **WHEN** a new-session Claude launch reports that its session ID is already in use and the one-time `--resume` retry also fails
- **THEN** the daemon MUST record the final interrupted outcome and MUST NOT spawn a third attempt in that recovery cycle

#### Scenario: Ordinary crash receives no fallback

- **WHEN** Claude exits non-zero without the deterministic session-conflict classification
- **THEN** the daemon MUST preserve the existing crash-reporting behavior and MUST NOT issue the one-time resume fallback

### Requirement: Exhausted deterministic conflicts do not enter automatic redispatch loops

After the one-time resume fallback for a session conflict is exhausted, the daemon MUST suppress subsequent synthetic automatic crash resumes for the same direct session/entity key in that daemon process. It MUST emit a visible diagnostic when suppressing a wake. A fresh human instruction for that key MUST clear the guard and permit a new bounded recovery cycle. The guard MUST NOT affect other sessions, user-interrupt resumes, or unrelated crash types.

#### Scenario: Automatic crash resume is suppressed after exhaustion

- **WHEN** the resume fallback has failed for a deterministic session conflict and an automatic crash resume is redispatched for the same key
- **THEN** the daemon MUST log the suppression and MUST NOT spawn another Claude process

#### Scenario: Fresh human instruction permits recovery

- **WHEN** a session key is guarded after an exhausted deterministic conflict and a fresh human instruction arrives for that key
- **THEN** the daemon MUST clear the guard and permit one new bounded recovery cycle

#### Scenario: Other sessions remain unaffected

- **WHEN** one session key is guarded after an exhausted deterministic conflict
- **THEN** wakes and resume behavior for every other session key MUST continue unchanged

### Requirement: An interrupt with no live subprocess SHALL report the turn as interrupted

A daemon SHALL NOT silently ignore an `interrupt` control command that passes the
connection-identity check but finds no running child for the command's
`${entityType}:${entityUuid}`. It SHALL instead report the session's turn as `interrupted`
with reason `user` through the same turn-reporting transport the wake path uses, and SHALL
log that it did so. The session business key SHALL be derived exactly as the daemon derives it
elsewhere: for the `idea` and `daemon_session` control entity types it is the command's
`entityUuid`. For any other control entity type the daemon SHALL keep logging only, because
it cannot know which session that resource belongs to. The report SHALL be
fire-and-forget: a failing or throwing report MUST NOT propagate into the SSE control loop.

#### Scenario: No child for the targeted entity

- **WHEN** an `interrupt` for `idea:<uuid>` arrives on the correct connection and the
  daemon's execution registry has no running child for it
- **THEN** the daemon SHALL advance that session's turn to `interrupted` with reason `user`
  and SHALL log that no subprocess was found

#### Scenario: A live child is still killed and not reported here

- **WHEN** an `interrupt` arrives and the registry holds a running child
- **THEN** the daemon SHALL mark the entity interrupting and kill the process tree as before,
  and SHALL NOT itself report a terminal turn — the wake path reports the resulting exit

#### Scenario: An idea interrupt finds a sibling wake running on that session

- **WHEN** an `interrupt` for `idea:A` finds no running child under its own key, but the
  registry holds a running child for a child resource whose direct idea is A — that wake runs
  on session A
- **THEN** the daemon SHALL interrupt THAT wake (marking the sibling's own entity interrupting
  so its exit is attributed to the user) and SHALL NOT report a turn miss, which would settle
  the sibling's turn while its subprocess kept running

#### Scenario: A failing report cannot break the control loop

- **WHEN** the no-child report rejects or throws
- **THEN** the control handler SHALL return normally and the failure SHALL be visible in the
  daemon log

### Requirement: A running turn SHALL always offer an interrupt control

The conversation composer SHALL render an interrupt control whenever the conversation has a
`running` turn, including when no live execution row matches the conversation. When no
execution row matches, the control's target SHALL be derived from the conversation's own
session — `idea:<directIdeaUuid>` for an idea-anchored conversation and
`daemon_session:<sessionId>` for an ad-hoc one, addressed at the session's origin
connection — using the same derivation rule the execution-matching helper applies, kept in
one shared pure function so the two cannot drift. The interrupt control MUST NOT be given a
synthesized execution row; it SHALL accept a minimal target shape that a real execution row
structurally satisfies. The zombie-clearing variant SHALL carry its own user-facing copy in
every supported locale, so a human is not told a live process was killed when none existed.
When the composer is read-only because the conversation's origin daemon is offline, its
read-only notice SHALL state that a stuck turn can still be cleared, whenever a
zombie-clearing target is present.

#### Scenario: Running turn with no matching execution row

- **WHEN** a conversation's latest turn is `running` and no execution row matches the
  conversation
- **THEN** the composer SHALL render the interrupt control targeting the conversation's own
  session key on its origin connection, with the zombie-clearing copy

#### Scenario: A stale terminal execution row alongside a running turn

- **WHEN** a conversation's latest turn is `running` while its only matching execution row is
  terminal (`interrupted`, whether the reason is `user` or `crash`) — the two disagree, so no
  live run exists
- **THEN** the composer SHALL render the zombie-clearing control rather than only that row's
  resume affordance, so the turn cannot be left permanently unclearable; and once the turn is
  no longer `running` the row's resume affordance SHALL return unchanged

#### Scenario: Running execution row present

- **WHEN** a conversation has a matching `running` execution row
- **THEN** the composer SHALL render the existing interrupt control targeting that execution
  row, with unchanged copy and behaviour

#### Scenario: Idle conversation

- **WHEN** a conversation has no `running` turn and no matching execution row
- **THEN** the composer SHALL render no interrupt control

#### Scenario: Read-only notice while a stuck turn is clearable

- **WHEN** the composer is read-only because the origin daemon is offline and a
  zombie-clearing target is present
- **THEN** the read-only notice SHALL say the stuck turn can still be cleared here, and the
  notice SHALL be unchanged when no such target is present

### Requirement: The control endpoint SHALL settle the turn when no live run can act on the interrupt

`POST /api/daemon/control` SHALL continue to publish the control event and SHALL keep its
existing authorization and non-disclosure behaviour unchanged. Additionally, for an
`interrupt` command, it SHALL settle that session's `running` turn as `interrupted` with
reason `user` — through the same turn-advance service chokepoint the daemon's own reports
use — whenever the server's own state shows no live run that could act on the command: the
target connection is not effectively online, **or** that connection reports no `running`
execution for the targeted entity. It SHALL NOT settle when the connection is effectively
online **and** reports a `running` execution for that entity, because in that window the
daemon owns the outcome. Both determinations SHALL reuse the existing company-scoped
predicates over the connection registry and execution snapshot rather than restating their
rules. An `idea` control key SHALL count a `running` execution reported against a CHILD
resource of that idea (a sibling wake, matched by its direct idea) as a live run, because
such a wake runs on that idea's session. The endpoint SHALL resolve which session the entity
key denotes rather than assuming the key IS the session's business key, and SHALL settle
nothing when that resolution is empty or ambiguous. The response SHALL indicate whether a
settle occurred; neither a failed settle NOR a failed liveness/evidence query SHALL fail the
dispatch, since the control event is published first.

#### Scenario: A sibling wake on the same session counts as a live run

- **WHEN** an authorized caller interrupts `idea:A` on an effectively online connection that
  reports no `running` execution for `idea:A` itself, but does report one for a child
  resource whose direct idea is A
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL treat that as a live run, SHALL NOT settle any turn, and SHALL
  report that it did not settle

#### Scenario: A legacy residual session is not confused with a modern one

- **WHEN** an authorized caller interrupts `idea:A` and the agent has both a modern session
  keyed `A` and a legacy residual session keyed `A::<connectionUuid>` on the target
  connection, exactly one of which holds a `running` turn
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL settle the turn of the session that holds it, and SHALL NOT
  settle the other

#### Scenario: An ambiguous session resolution settles nothing

- **WHEN** two candidate sessions for the same entity key BOTH hold a `running` turn
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL settle neither, and SHALL report that it did not settle

#### Scenario: A failing liveness or evidence query does not fail the dispatch

- **WHEN** the liveness or execution-evidence query throws after the control event has been
  published
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL still succeed, SHALL report that it did not settle, and SHALL
  NOT attempt a settle

#### Scenario: Interrupt against an offline connection

- **WHEN** an authorized caller interrupts an entity whose target connection is offline and
  whose session has a `running` turn
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL publish the control event, SHALL settle that turn as
  `interrupted` with reason `user`, and SHALL report that it settled

#### Scenario: Interrupt against an online connection with a live run

- **WHEN** an authorized caller interrupts an entity whose target connection is effectively
  online and which reports a `running` execution for that entity
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL publish the control event, SHALL NOT settle any turn, and SHALL
  report that it did not settle

#### Scenario: Interrupt against an online connection whose reverse channel is silently dead

- **WHEN** an authorized caller interrupts an entity whose target connection is effectively
  online but which reports no `running` execution for that entity, while the session's turn
  is still `running`
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL publish the control event, SHALL settle that turn as
  `interrupted` with reason `user`, and SHALL report that it settled

#### Scenario: Resume never settles

- **WHEN** an authorized caller issues a `resume` command, whether the connection is online
  or offline
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL NOT settle any turn

#### Scenario: No running turn to settle

- **WHEN** an interrupt targets an offline connection whose session has no `running` turn
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL succeed, SHALL change no turn, and SHALL report that it did not
  settle
