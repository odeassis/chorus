# openclaw-event-bridge Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-openclaw-plugin. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The plugin SHALL run the SSE notification listener as a registered background service

The plugin MUST register a background service via `api.registerService({ id, start, stop })` that opens the Chorus SSE notification stream (`<chorusUrl>/api/events/notifications`, Bearer auth) on `start` and closes it on `stop`. The listener MUST reconnect with exponential backoff (initial 1s, capped at 30s) and MUST back-fill unread notifications on reconnect.

#### Scenario: Service starts and stops the SSE stream

- **WHEN** the registered service's `start` is invoked
- **THEN** the plugin MUST open the SSE connection to `<chorusUrl>/api/events/notifications` with an `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header
- **AND** when `stop` is invoked, the plugin MUST abort the stream and disconnect the slim MCP client

#### Scenario: Dropped stream reconnects with capped backoff

- **GIVEN** an established SSE connection that drops unexpectedly
- **WHEN** the listener detects the drop
- **THEN** it MUST schedule a reconnect with delay that doubles from 1s up to a 30s cap
- **AND** on successful reconnect it MUST reset the backoff delay
- **AND** on reconnect it MUST query unread notifications so events missed during the gap are not lost

### Requirement: The plugin SHALL wake the agent in-process via enqueueSystemEvent, not via the HTTP hooks endpoint

When an actionable notification arrives, the event router MUST wake the agent by calling `api.runtime.system.enqueueSystemEvent(text, { sessionKey, contextKey })`. The legacy HTTP POST to the gateway `/hooks/wake` endpoint MUST be removed. The `contextKey` MUST be derived from the notification so duplicate notifications collapse to a single wake.

#### Scenario: No /hooks/wake HTTP call remains

- **WHEN** `packages/openclaw-plugin/src/` is grepped for `/hooks/wake`
- **THEN** there MUST be zero matches
- **AND** there MUST be no `fetch` call whose purpose is to wake the agent

#### Scenario: Actionable notification enqueues a system event

- **GIVEN** an incoming `new_notification` SSE event whose underlying notification action is one the router handles (e.g. `task_assigned`)
- **WHEN** the router dispatches it
- **THEN** it MUST call `api.runtime.system.enqueueSystemEvent` with a human-readable message containing the entity title and UUID
- **AND** it MUST pass a `contextKey` derived from the notification action and entity UUID

#### Scenario: Duplicate notifications collapse via contextKey

- **GIVEN** two SSE events that resolve to the same notification action and entity
- **WHEN** both are dispatched before the agent consumes the first
- **THEN** the two enqueue calls MUST share the same `contextKey`
- **AND** the queue's deduplication MUST prevent a second identical system event from being delivered

#### Scenario: No resolvable session is handled gracefully

- **GIVEN** a runtime where no agent session key can be resolved (e.g. headless with no active agent)
- **WHEN** the router attempts to wake the agent
- **THEN** it MUST log that the wake was dropped for lack of a session
- **AND** it MUST NOT throw, MUST NOT crash the service, and MUST NOT fabricate a session

### Requirement: The autoStart behavior SHALL be preserved under the new wake mechanism

When `autoStart` is enabled and a `task_assigned` notification arrives, the plugin MUST claim the task via the slim MCP client before enqueuing the wake, matching the pre-refactor behavior.

#### Scenario: autoStart claims the task before waking

- **GIVEN** `autoStart` is `true` and a `task_assigned` notification for an open task
- **WHEN** the router handles it
- **THEN** it MUST call `chorus_claim_task` for that task UUID via the slim MCP client
- **AND** it MUST then enqueue the wake system event referencing the same task
- **AND** if the claim fails, it MUST still enqueue the wake (so the agent can handle the task manually) and log the claim failure

#### Scenario: autoStart disabled does not claim

- **GIVEN** `autoStart` is `false` and a `task_assigned` notification
- **WHEN** the router handles it
- **THEN** it MUST NOT call `chorus_claim_task`
- **AND** it MUST still enqueue a wake informing the agent the task is available to review

### Requirement: The OpenClaw plugin SHALL self-report client metadata when opening the notification stream

The OpenClaw plugin's SSE notification listener SHALL append self-report query
parameters when it opens its subscription to `/api/events/notifications`. The
appended parameters SHALL be `clientType=openclaw`, `clientVersion` set to the
plugin version, `host` set to the machine hostname, and `startedAt` set to the
plugin process start time in ISO-8601. The `clientType` SHALL be `openclaw` so the server's
connection registry can distinguish an OpenClaw daemon from a chorus CLI
(`claude_code`) daemon. This SHALL NOT change the authentication mechanism (the
Bearer `cho_` API key header is unchanged) and SHALL NOT alter the listener's
reconnect behavior.

#### Scenario: The OpenClaw listener appends self-report params on connect

- **WHEN** the OpenClaw plugin opens its notification SSE subscription
- **THEN** the request URL MUST include `clientType=openclaw` together with the
  plugin's `clientVersion`, the machine `host`, and the process `startedAt`
- **AND** the `Authorization: Bearer <cho_ key>` header MUST be sent exactly as before

#### Scenario: The server distinguishes OpenClaw from chorus CLI connections

- **GIVEN** one OpenClaw plugin and one chorus CLI daemon both connected for the same agent
- **WHEN** the server registers each connection
- **THEN** the OpenClaw connection MUST be recorded with `clientType = "openclaw"`
- **AND** the chorus CLI connection MUST be recorded with `clientType = "claude_code"`

### Requirement: The plugin SHALL capture its own connectionUuid from the connection_registered event

The OpenClaw plugin's SSE listener SHALL expose an `onConnectionId` callback and the server's post-handshake `connection_registered` event (carrying `connectionUuid`) SHALL be routed to it and stored as the connection's identity, rather than being discarded as an unhandled event. The stored `connectionUuid` SHALL be made available to the daemon reporting client and the control handler. On reconnect, the listener SHALL refresh the stored `connectionUuid` from the new `connection_registered` event. The `connection_registered` event SHALL NOT enter the wake path.

#### Scenario: connection_registered populates the stored connectionUuid

- **WHEN** the server sends a `connection_registered` event after the SSE handshake
- **THEN** the plugin MUST store the supplied `connectionUuid` as its connection identity
- **AND** that value MUST be readable by the daemon reporting client and the control handler

#### Scenario: connection_registered is not treated as a wake

- **WHEN** the `connection_registered` event is dispatched
- **THEN** it MUST NOT enqueue a wake or spawn an agent run
- **AND** it MUST NOT be logged as an ignored/unhandled event

#### Scenario: Reconnect refreshes the connectionUuid

- **GIVEN** an established connection whose stream drops and reconnects
- **WHEN** the server sends a new `connection_registered` on reconnect
- **THEN** the plugin MUST replace its stored `connectionUuid` with the new value

### Requirement: The plugin SHALL subscribe and route the reverse control channel without entering the wake path

The OpenClaw plugin's SSE listener SHALL expose an `onControl` callback and SHALL fork SSE events whose `type` is `control` to a control handler, distinct from the `new_notification` wake path. The control handler SHALL act on a command only when the event's `targetConnectionUuid` equals the plugin's stored `connectionUuid` (and, for `interrupt`, only when the plugin currently holds a running entity matching the command), and SHALL otherwise log and ignore the command. A control event SHALL NEVER enqueue a wake or spawn a new agent run for the control event itself. The handler SHALL route `interrupt`, `resume`, and `deliver_turn` to their respective behaviors (defined by the `openclaw-daemon-client` capability).

#### Scenario: A control event is forked to the control handler, not the wake path

- **WHEN** the plugin receives an SSE event with `type = "control"`
- **THEN** it MUST route the event to the control handler via `onControl`
- **AND** it MUST NOT enqueue a wake or spawn an agent run for the control event

#### Scenario: A control command for another connection is ignored

- **GIVEN** the plugin's stored `connectionUuid` is C
- **WHEN** it receives a control command whose `targetConnectionUuid` is not C
- **THEN** it MUST log and ignore the command and MUST NOT abort, resume, or deliver anything

#### Scenario: The three control commands are routed

- **WHEN** the control handler receives a verified `interrupt`, `resume`, or `deliver_turn` command for its own connection
- **THEN** it MUST route `interrupt` to abort the matching in-flight run, `resume` to re-dispatch the entity's wake, and `deliver_turn` to the connection-scoped pending-turns sweep

### Requirement: The plugin SHALL route the daemon's stage-advance wake actions to an embedded-agent wake

The OpenClaw plugin's event router SHALL handle the three human-initiated stage-advance notification actions — `elaboration_verified`, `start_development`, and `yolo_requested` — by waking the embedded agent with an action-appropriate prompt, rather than letting them fall through to the unhandled-action default. Each wake SHALL be idea-anchored (the notification entity is the idea), SHALL carry a `contextKey` derived from the action and the entity UUID so duplicate deliveries collapse to one wake, and SHALL include `@mention` guidance addressing the actor. The prompt wording MAY differ from the CLI daemon's (`cli/prompts.mjs`) wording, but SHALL preserve each action's instructional contract:

- `elaboration_verified` SHALL instruct the agent that the idea is now elaborated, that it MUST NOT answer elaboration questions, and that it SHALL write the proposal via the existing proposal flow.
- `start_development` SHALL instruct the agent to claim and execute ALL remaining tasks of the idea's approved proposal in dependency order, looping until no claimable task remains, and SHALL NOT instruct it to stop after a single task.
- `yolo_requested` SHALL instruct the agent to drive the whole idea to done via the yolo skill, resuming from the idea's current phase, and SHALL instruct it NOT to merge or push a pull request without explicit human approval.

#### Scenario: elaboration_verified wakes the agent to write the proposal

- **GIVEN** the plugin receives a `new_notification` SSE event whose notification action is `elaboration_verified` for an idea
- **WHEN** the router dispatches it
- **THEN** it MUST wake the embedded agent with a message instructing it to write the proposal (not to answer elaboration questions)
- **AND** the wake's `contextKey` MUST be derived from the `elaboration_verified` action and the idea UUID

#### Scenario: start_development wakes the agent to execute all remaining tasks

- **GIVEN** the plugin receives a `new_notification` SSE event whose notification action is `start_development` for an idea
- **WHEN** the router dispatches it
- **THEN** it MUST wake the embedded agent with a message instructing it to claim and execute all remaining tasks in dependency order, looping until none are claimable
- **AND** the wake's `contextKey` MUST be derived from the `start_development` action and the idea UUID

#### Scenario: yolo_requested wakes the agent to drive the idea to done

- **GIVEN** the plugin receives a `new_notification` SSE event whose notification action is `yolo_requested` for an idea
- **WHEN** the router dispatches it
- **THEN** it MUST wake the embedded agent with a message instructing it to drive the idea to done via the yolo skill, resuming from the idea's current phase
- **AND** the message MUST instruct the agent not to merge or push a pull request without explicit human approval
- **AND** the wake's `contextKey` MUST be derived from the `yolo_requested` action and the idea UUID

#### Scenario: A stage-advance action is no longer treated as unhandled

- **WHEN** the router dispatches any of `elaboration_verified`, `start_development`, or `yolo_requested`
- **THEN** it MUST NOT log the action as an unhandled notification action
- **AND** it MUST produce exactly one wake for that notification

### Requirement: The plugin's handled wake actions SHALL stay in lockstep with the daemon's wake actions

A repository-level test SHALL enforce that the set of notification actions the OpenClaw plugin's event router handles is a superset of the daemon's wake-action set (`WAKE_ACTIONS` exported from `cli/prompts.mjs`), excluding only the actions that are delivered off the notification `switch` by design — the reverse-control-channel resume (`resource_resumed`) and the turn-delivered instruction and dedicated operations (`human_instruction`, `idea_creation_requested`, `research_requested`). The test SHALL live where the repository's main test runner collects it (a location the root Vitest `include` covers and its `packages` exclude does not), so it runs in the main CI and can read both the daemon and plugin sources. When a wake action exists in the daemon set (outside the excluded set) but is not handled by the plugin router, the test SHALL fail and SHALL name the missing action(s).

#### Scenario: A new daemon wake action not ported to the plugin fails the guard

- **GIVEN** the daemon's `WAKE_ACTIONS` gains a new action that is not in the control/turn-delivered exclusion set
- **WHEN** that action is not added to the plugin router's handled cases
- **THEN** the lockstep test MUST fail
- **AND** the failure MUST identify the missing action by name

#### Scenario: The current stage-advance actions satisfy the guard

- **GIVEN** the plugin router handles `elaboration_verified`, `start_development`, and `yolo_requested`
- **WHEN** the lockstep test runs
- **THEN** it MUST pass
- **AND** it MUST NOT require the plugin to handle `resource_resumed`, `human_instruction`, `idea_creation_requested` or `research_requested` (which are delivered off the notification switch)

#### Scenario: Dedicated operations have one delivery path
- **WHEN** dedicated operation actions appear in notification broadcasts
- **THEN** both daemon and plugin notification routers defer their execution to the authorized turn-delivery mechanism, and the lockstep guard excludes exactly those named operations without weakening its checks for other actions
