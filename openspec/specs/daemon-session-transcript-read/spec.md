# daemon-session-transcript-read Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change chat-style-daemon-ui. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Single-session transcript read API

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/daemon-sessions/{sessionUuid}` returning the
session together with its ordered turns, each turn carrying its retained
`user`/`assistant` transcript messages. The endpoint SHALL apply the same
owner/self + company visibility fence as the session list: an AGENT-KEY caller
sees only its own sessions; a USER / super_admin caller sees only sessions of
agents they own. A session that does not exist, lives in another company, or
belongs to an agent the caller does not own SHALL all yield the SAME 404
(non-disclosure) — the response MUST NOT reveal that another caller's session
exists.

#### Scenario: Owner reads a visible session's transcript

- **WHEN** a caller requests `GET /api/daemon-sessions/{sessionUuid}` for a
  session whose agent they own (or, for an agent key, their own session)
- **THEN** the response is `200` with `{ session, turns }` where each turn
  includes its messages ordered by `seq`, and the turns are ordered by `seq`

#### Scenario: Non-visible session is indistinguishable from missing

- **WHEN** a caller requests a session that does not exist, OR belongs to another
  company, OR belongs to an agent they do not own
- **THEN** the response is `404` in every case, with no field that distinguishes
  "exists but forbidden" from "does not exist"

#### Scenario: Turns and messages reflect the rolling window

- **WHEN** a visible session has had transcript messages trimmed by the
  rolling-window cap
- **THEN** the read returns only the retained messages (the trimmed-away oldest
  messages are absent), and a turn whose messages were all trimmed still appears
  as a turn with an empty message list

#### Scenario: Read failure is surfaced, not swallowed

- **WHEN** the underlying query fails
- **THEN** the endpoint returns a `500` (the read does not degrade a failure to an
  empty transcript)

### Requirement: Live transcript subscription for the open conversation

The frontend SHALL render the open conversation's turns and messages incrementally
from the `transcript:{sessionUuid}` SSE channel rather than polling. The SSE
endpoint SHALL forward `transcript` events for a session ONLY to a caller to whom
that session is visible, dropping events for other companies or non-owned agents
(consistent with the existing change / presence / execution multi-tenancy drops).
The three triggers — `turn_created`, `turn_status_changed`, `transcript_appended`
— SHALL each update the open conversation without a full refetch.

#### Scenario: A new turn appears live

- **WHEN** the open conversation receives a `turn_created` event
- **THEN** a new turn band is appended to the transcript without a page refresh

#### Scenario: A turn's status changes live

- **WHEN** the open conversation receives a `turn_status_changed` event
  (e.g. `pending → running → ended`)
- **THEN** the corresponding turn band's status indicator updates in place

#### Scenario: Appended transcript text renders live

- **WHEN** the open conversation receives a `transcript_appended` event
- **THEN** the affected turn's message list grows by the appended messages,
  without re-fetching the whole session

#### Scenario: Events for a non-visible session are not delivered

- **WHEN** a `transcript` event is published for a session the caller cannot see
- **THEN** the caller's SSE stream does not receive it

### Requirement: Chat-style conversation surface

The "View all" daemon modal SHALL present a chat-style two-pane layout: a left
pane with a small agent selector and that agent's conversation list (all of the
selected agent's sessions, active and ended, ordered newest-first by
`lastTurnAt`, paginated), and a right pane showing the selected conversation's
turn-by-turn transcript. Each turn band SHALL display its wake trigger
(task_assigned / mentioned / elaboration / human_instruction / resume) and its
live status, and an entity-bearing turn SHALL link to its related task/idea.
Connection metadata (host, client version, uptime, started) SHALL be demoted from
the headline to a secondary/collapsible position. The right pane SHALL offer
inline send-instruction and interrupt controls, each gated on the session's origin
being online. When an entry point focuses a specific visible session UUID, the
surface SHALL load and display that exact transcript even when the target session
is older than the selected agent's currently loaded server-paginated page. The
focused read SHALL add only that target session to the local conversation rows and
MUST NOT restore an unbounded all-history list read. If the focused session cannot
be loaded, the surface SHALL clear the unresolved selection and fall back to the
selected agent's conversation list.

#### Scenario: Selecting an agent then a conversation

- **WHEN** a user opens the modal, picks an agent in the selector, and selects a
  conversation from the left list
- **THEN** the right pane renders that conversation's turns with their messages,
  with the most recent turn visible

#### Scenario: Trigger provenance is visible per turn

- **WHEN** a conversation contains turns of different triggers (e.g. a
  task_assigned turn and a human_instruction turn)
- **THEN** each turn band shows a label/glyph identifying its trigger, and the
  entity-bearing turn shows a link to its related task or idea

#### Scenario: Read-only when origin offline

- **WHEN** the selected conversation's origin connection is offline
- **THEN** the transcript history still renders, the send composer's direct-send
  is disabled with a visible reason, and the interrupt control is not offered

#### Scenario: Running turn is visually distinguished

- **WHEN** a turn in the open conversation is in the `running` status
- **THEN** the turn band is visually marked as running (with motion only under
  `motion-safe`; reduced-motion shows a static marker)

#### Scenario: Empty state is an invitation, not an error

- **WHEN** the selected agent has no conversations
- **THEN** the surface shows a calm empty state that invites starting a
  conversation, never an error treatment

#### Scenario: A focused session outside the first page opens directly

- **WHEN** the Idea Tracker or another entry point focuses a visible session UUID
  that is not present in the selected agent's currently loaded conversation page
- **THEN** the surface reads that session by UUID and directly renders its transcript
- **AND** mobile opens the transcript drill-down while desktop selects the same
  transcript in the two-pane layout
- **AND** only the focused row is added locally; the bounded server pagination
  remains in effect

#### Scenario: An unavailable focused session falls back safely

- **WHEN** a focused session UUID cannot be read because it is missing, no longer
  visible, or the request fails
- **THEN** the unresolved selection is cleared
- **AND** the surface falls back to the selected agent's conversation list without
  leaving an empty mobile drill-down or requesting the full conversation history

### Requirement: The conversation surface SHALL be a near-full-height bottom sheet on mobile with the reply input kept reachable

On a mobile-width viewport (below the `sm` breakpoint), the "View all" daemon conversation surface SHALL open from the bottom as a near-full-height sheet using the product's existing mobile Sheet visual language and entrance/exit motion. The sheet SHALL leave a fixed 16 CSS-pixel strip of backdrop visible above it, use rounded top corners and a visible top handle within a compact 28 CSS-pixel handle row, and retain a height bounded by the dynamic viewport so mobile browser chrome and safe-area insets do not make the reply composer unreachable. The selected conversation's transcript SHALL fill the middle region and scroll within itself, and the reply/send input SHALL remain at the bottom of the bounded sheet without dead space below it.

The mobile sheet SHALL close when the user clicks/taps the exposed backdrop, presses Escape, or drags the sheet's top handle downward at least 96 CSS pixels. It SHALL NOT render the shared Sheet primitive's default top-right close control. Drag recognition SHALL be limited to the top handle: vertical scrolling or swiping within the conversation list, transcript, or composer MUST NOT move or dismiss the sheet. A handle drag released before 96 CSS pixels SHALL return the sheet to its resting position, respecting reduced-motion preferences.

On desktop-width viewports (`sm` and above), the conversation surface SHALL remain the existing floating, height-capped dialog, and on `lg` and above the two-pane conversation-list + transcript layout SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: Mobile conversation opens as a bottom sheet

- **WHEN** a user opens the daemon conversation surface below the `sm` breakpoint
- **THEN** it enters from the bottom as a near-full-height sheet with rounded top corners and a visible top handle
- **AND** a fixed 16 CSS-pixel backdrop strip remains visible above the sheet
- **AND** the transcript scrolls within the bounded sheet while the reply/send input remains reachable at its bottom

#### Scenario: Backdrop and top handle dismiss the mobile sheet

- **WHEN** the mobile sheet is open and the user clicks or taps the exposed backdrop
- **THEN** the sheet closes through its normal exit motion
- **WHEN** the user instead drags the top handle downward by at least 96 CSS pixels
- **THEN** the sheet follows the handle and closes

#### Scenario: Conversation scrolling never drags the sheet

- **WHEN** the user scrolls or swipes vertically inside the conversation list, transcript, or composer
- **THEN** the content scrolls normally
- **AND** the sheet does not translate or dismiss
- **WHEN** a top-handle drag is released before 96 CSS pixels
- **THEN** the sheet returns to its resting position

#### Scenario: Keyboard dismissal remains available

- **WHEN** keyboard focus is inside the mobile sheet
- **THEN** pressing Escape closes it and restores focus according to the existing Radix behavior
- **AND** no top-right close control consumes mobile header space

#### Scenario: Desktop layout is preserved

- **WHEN** the same conversation surface is opened at the `sm` breakpoint or wider
- **THEN** it renders as the existing floating, height-capped dialog
- **AND** at `lg` and above the two-pane conversation-list + transcript layout and behavior are unchanged

#### Scenario: Both themes represent the mobile sheet

- **WHEN** the mobile conversation surface is delivered
- **THEN** the sheet remains legible and free of overflow in both light and dark themes

### Requirement: Wide markdown blocks in a transcript message SHALL be constrained to the available content width

When a transcript message renders Markdown that contains a wide block — a table, a code block, a long word or URL, or a wide image — the block SHALL be constrained to the message's available content width rather than overflowing it. A table or code block SHALL scroll horizontally within its own region while preserving its layout; long words and URLs SHALL wrap; a wide image SHALL be scaled down to the available width. The message bubble, the transcript column, and the overall modal SHALL NOT be widened by such a block — no horizontal overflow of the conversation container SHALL occur, on mobile or desktop. This constraint applies to the daemon transcript message renderer; the change SHALL NOT alter the shared application-wide Markdown rendering behavior for Ideas, Comments, or Documents unless that behavior is verified to be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A markdown table does not overflow the conversation

- **WHEN** a transcript message contains a Markdown table wider than the available content width, rendered on a mobile-width viewport
- **THEN** the conversation container does not overflow horizontally (the overall layout width is not blown out)
- **AND** the table scrolls horizontally within its own region with its column layout preserved

#### Scenario: Long words, URLs, and wide images are contained

- **WHEN** a transcript message contains a very long unbroken word or URL, or an image wider than the content width
- **THEN** the long word or URL wraps within the available width
- **AND** the image is scaled down to fit the available width
- **AND** the message bubble width is not widened past the conversation container

#### Scenario: Shared markdown surfaces are not regressed

- **WHEN** the transcript content-width constraint is implemented
- **THEN** the rendering of Ideas, Comments, and Document markdown content is unchanged
- **AND** any constraint applied at the shared renderer level is only retained if those surfaces are verified visually unchanged

#### Scenario: The scrolling-ancestor content wrapper does not defeat the width constraint

- **WHEN** the transcript is rendered inside a scroll container (e.g. Radix `ScrollArea`) whose viewport injects a content wrapper sized to its content's max-content width (such as an inline `display:table; min-width:100%` wrapper)
- **THEN** that injected wrapper SHALL be constrained to the viewport width (e.g. forced to `display:block`) so a wide block cannot grow it past the viewport
- **AND** the `min-width:0` shrink chain on the transcript markup SHALL be effective rather than defeated by an unbounded ancestor
- **AND** the override SHALL be scoped to the daemon transcript scroll container, leaving other scroll areas unaffected

### Requirement: Message-level transcript pagination with a composite cursor

The single-session transcript read SHALL paginate the conversation by **message**,
not by turn. `GET /api/daemon-sessions/{sessionUuid}` SHALL return at most
`DEFAULT_TRANSCRIPT_MESSAGE_PAGE` (default 20) messages per page, newest-first
windowed but returned in ascending render order, rebuilding the (possibly partial)
turn bands that own the page's messages. The endpoint SHALL accept an optional
composite cursor `beforeTurnSeq` + `beforeMsgSeq`; when supplied it SHALL return the
messages strictly older than that cursor under the ordering
`turn.seq DESC, message.seq DESC`, i.e. messages where
`turn.seq < beforeTurnSeq OR (turn.seq = beforeTurnSeq AND message.seq < beforeMsgSeq)`.
Omitting the cursor SHALL return the most recent page. The response SHALL report
`hasMore` (whether older messages exist before this page) and the next cursor as
`oldestTurnSeq` / `oldestMsgSeq` (the position of the oldest message in the page).
The page size SHALL be clamped to a sane range so a hostile `limit` cannot request
an unbounded scan. This message-level contract REPLACES the prior turn-level window
(`DEFAULT_TRANSCRIPT_TURN_PAGE`, single `beforeSeq` cursor); the turn-level
parameters SHALL NOT be retained in parallel.

#### Scenario: First page returns the newest messages

- **WHEN** a caller requests `GET /api/daemon-sessions/{sessionUuid}` with no cursor
  for a visible session that has more than `DEFAULT_TRANSCRIPT_MESSAGE_PAGE` messages
- **THEN** the response contains the newest `DEFAULT_TRANSCRIPT_MESSAGE_PAGE` messages,
  grouped into their turns ascending by turn `seq` and message `seq`
- **AND** `hasMore` is `true`
- **AND** the response carries `oldestTurnSeq` / `oldestMsgSeq` for the oldest message returned

#### Scenario: Load-earlier walks back by the composite cursor

- **WHEN** the caller requests the same session with
  `?beforeTurnSeq=<oldestTurnSeq>&beforeMsgSeq=<oldestMsgSeq>` from the previous page
- **THEN** the response contains only messages strictly older than that composite
  position (`turn.seq < beforeTurnSeq`, or equal turn with `message.seq < beforeMsgSeq`)
- **AND** no message from the previous page is repeated and none between the pages is skipped

#### Scenario: A page boundary falls inside a turn

- **WHEN** a single turn holds more messages than fit in one page
- **THEN** the turn appears as a partial band carrying only that page's messages,
  and a subsequent load-earlier returns the remaining older messages of the same turn
  merged into the same band

#### Scenario: hasMore is false at the start of the conversation

- **WHEN** the caller has paged back to the oldest retained message of the session
- **THEN** the response for the earliest page reports `hasMore` is `false`

### Requirement: Every turn keeps a positional slot so no turn band is dropped

The read projection SHALL give every turn at least one positional slot at
`(turn.seq, seq = 0)` in the unified message stream, so the message-level pager
never drops a turn band. This preserves the turn-level pager's guarantee that every
turn remains reachable — including a turn whose messages were all removed by the
rolling-window cap, which the old pager returned with an empty message list. The
slot behaves as follows:

- For a turn with a non-empty `promptText` (e.g. a `human_instruction` turn), the
  `seq = 0` slot SHALL carry a synthetic message with `role = "user"` and `text`
  equal to the promptText.
- For a turn with no `promptText` and no retained real messages (e.g. an autonomous
  `agent_wake` turn whose messages were all trimmed), the `seq = 0` slot SHALL still
  reserve the turn's place so the turn is returned as a band with an empty rendered
  message list — never silently dropped.

Each `seq = 0` slot SHALL carry a stable `uuid` derived from its turn so the
frontend's uuid-keyed merge de-duplicates it across pages, re-fetches, and live
events; SHALL sort ahead of the turn's real messages (which begin at `seq = 1`);
SHALL count toward the page size; and SHALL participate in the composite cursor
exactly like a real message. The slot SHALL exist only in the read projection — it
SHALL NOT be persisted and SHALL NOT require any schema or message-role change.

#### Scenario: A prompt-only turn is not skipped by the pager

- **WHEN** the page window reaches a `human_instruction` turn that has a `promptText`
  but no stored transcript messages
- **THEN** that turn appears in the result as a band whose only message is the
  synthetic `seq = 0`, `role = "user"` message carrying the promptText

#### Scenario: A message-less, prompt-less turn is still returned as an empty band

- **WHEN** the page window reaches a turn with `promptText = null` whose retained
  transcript messages were all removed by the rolling-window cap
- **THEN** that turn is still returned as a turn band (with an empty rendered message
  list), not silently dropped from the transcript
- **AND** it occupies exactly one position in the composite cursor sequence so paging
  does not stall or loop on it

#### Scenario: The synthetic message orders ahead of real messages in its turn

- **WHEN** a turn has both a `promptText` and one or more stored `assistant`/`user`
  messages (`seq >= 1`)
- **THEN** the rebuilt turn band lists the synthetic promptText message first,
  followed by the real messages in ascending `seq`

#### Scenario: The positional slot is stable across an overlapping fetch

- **WHEN** a page that includes a turn's `seq = 0` slot is merged with another page
  or a live event that also references the same turn
- **THEN** the slot is de-duplicated by its stable uuid and is not rendered twice

### Requirement: The daemon conversation surface SHALL minimize header chrome and top-align content

The daemon conversation surface ("View all" chat modal) SHALL NOT render a visible header subtitle describing the surface; the surface's visible heading (title) SHALL be retained, but the explanatory subtitle line SHALL be removed so it does not consume vertical space inside the conversation view. The conversation content (the two-pane layout on desktop, the list/drill-down on mobile) SHALL be top-aligned — its top edge SHALL sit close to the modal's top edge, without the excess vertical padding/gap that previously pushed it down. Removing the visible subtitle SHALL NOT remove the modal's accessibility description: the hidden Radix `DialogDescription` used to satisfy the dialog's "described-by" requirement SHALL continue to resolve a localized string, independent of the visible header.

#### Scenario: No visible subtitle in the conversation header

- **WHEN** the daemon conversation surface renders (desktop or mobile)
- **THEN** the visible heading (title) MUST be present
- **AND** no visible explanatory subtitle line MUST be shown beneath it

#### Scenario: Content is top-aligned on desktop

- **WHEN** the surface renders on a desktop-width (`lg`+) viewport
- **THEN** the two-pane conversation content's top edge MUST sit near the modal's top edge, with no large empty band above it

#### Scenario: The dialog accessibility description is preserved

- **WHEN** the conversation modal mounts after the visible subtitle is removed
- **THEN** the modal MUST still provide an accessibility description (a hidden `DialogDescription`) that resolves a localized string
- **AND** that description MUST be a separate node from the (now removed) visible subtitle

### Requirement: Running status SHALL be carried in the transcript header rather than a standalone footer card

The conversation's running status — a running indicator plus the elapsed run time of the conversation's running execution — SHALL be presented in the transcript header (alongside the existing running marker), and the standalone running/interrupted execution card SHALL NOT occupy a separate row in the conversation footer. The elapsed time SHALL update live (using the same monotonic elapsed formatter the execution rows use) and SHALL respect reduced-motion for any animated indicator. The running status in the header SHALL NOT include a deep-link to the underlying task/idea; the conversation's header title remains the navigational affordance. Removing the standalone footer card SHALL NOT remove the visibility of which work is running and for how long.

#### Scenario: Elapsed run time appears in the header while running

- **WHEN** the open conversation has a running execution
- **THEN** the transcript header MUST show a running indicator and the elapsed run time
- **AND** the elapsed time MUST advance live without a manual refresh

#### Scenario: No standalone running card in the footer

- **WHEN** the open conversation has a running or interrupted execution
- **THEN** the footer MUST NOT render a standalone execution card on its own row above the input
- **AND** the running-state information MUST instead be available in the header (running + elapsed)

#### Scenario: The header running status carries no deep link

- **WHEN** the running status renders in the header
- **THEN** it MUST show only the running indicator and elapsed time (no separate link to the task/idea)
- **AND** the conversation header title MUST remain the navigational affordance

### Requirement: Interrupt, Resume, and Send SHALL be consolidated into the reply input's action row

The reply composer SHALL present a single action area at the bottom-right of the input box that hosts the conversation's controls together: Send SHALL always be present; when the conversation has a running execution, an Interrupt control SHALL appear alongside Send; when the conversation has a user-interrupted execution, a Resume control SHALL appear; a crash-interrupted execution SHALL show no Resume control (the existing "auto-recovers" hint is retained and remains visible). The Interrupt control SHALL retain its confirmation dialog (a destructive-action confirm) wherever it is rendered. The Interrupt and Resume controls SHALL issue the same control/resume requests they do today (no change to the `/api/daemon/control` interrupt or `/api/daemon/resume` resume behavior). While a turn is running, the input textarea SHALL remain usable so the user can compose and send a follow-up instruction mid-run (reusing the existing instruction endpoint, which appends a `human_instruction` turn regardless of run state); this send-while-running SHALL require no backend change. When the conversation's origin connection is offline, the composer SHALL remain hard-disabled with its visible read-only reason, unchanged. This consolidated layout SHALL apply on both desktop (inline action row) and mobile (stacked action row beneath the textarea).

#### Scenario: Send is always present; Interrupt joins it while running

- **WHEN** the open conversation has a running execution and its origin is online
- **THEN** the input action row MUST show Send and, beside it, an Interrupt control
- **AND** the input textarea MUST remain usable (not disabled by the running state)

#### Scenario: Interrupt keeps its confirmation dialog

- **WHEN** the user activates the Interrupt control in the input action row
- **THEN** a confirmation dialog MUST be shown before any interrupt request is issued
- **AND** confirming MUST issue the same interrupt request as the prior standalone control

#### Scenario: Resume appears for a user-interrupted conversation; crash shows no Resume

- **WHEN** the open conversation's execution is interrupted with reason `user`
- **THEN** the input action row MUST show a Resume control
- **WHEN** instead the execution is interrupted with reason `crash`
- **THEN** no Resume control MUST be shown, and the existing "auto-recovers" hint MUST remain visible

#### Scenario: Sending a follow-up while a turn is running

- **GIVEN** the open conversation has a running execution and its origin is online
- **WHEN** the user types an instruction and sends it
- **THEN** the instruction MUST be submitted via the existing session instruction endpoint (appending a `human_instruction` turn)
- **AND** no backend change MUST be required for this to work

#### Scenario: Offline origin still hard-disables the composer

- **WHEN** the open conversation's origin connection is offline
- **THEN** the composer MUST be disabled with its visible localized read-only reason
- **AND** Send MUST NOT issue a request

#### Scenario: Consolidated controls on mobile use the stacked layout

- **WHEN** the conversation footer renders on a mobile (`< lg`) drill-down
- **THEN** the standalone execution card MUST NOT be present
- **AND** Send plus any Interrupt/Resume control MUST render in the stacked action area beneath the textarea

### Requirement: An interrupted turn SHALL render as a distinct terminal state, never as running

The conversation surface SHALL treat `status = "interrupted"` as a terminal turn state. An interrupted turn's band SHALL show an explicit "Interrupted" status label (localized in every supported locale), styled distinctly from both `running` (no spinner, no pulse, no elapsed-running timer) and plain `ended` (visually distinguishable as an abnormal termination). The transcript header's running probe and the conversation list's running indicator SHALL NOT match an interrupted turn. The `turn_status_changed` SSE event for a `running → interrupted` transition SHALL update the open conversation in place, exactly like the other status transitions, and the turn view payload SHALL carry `interruptedReason` so the UI can surface it.

#### Scenario: A turn interrupted by daemon exit stops rendering as running

- **GIVEN** an open conversation whose latest turn is `running`
- **WHEN** a `turn_status_changed` event arrives finalizing it `interrupted(offline)`
- **THEN** the turn band MUST switch to the "Interrupted" presentation without a page refresh
- **AND** the header running badge and the conversation list's running indicator MUST clear

#### Scenario: Interrupted is visually distinct from ended

- **WHEN** a transcript renders one `ended` turn and one `interrupted` turn
- **THEN** the two MUST be distinguishable (the interrupted band carries the "Interrupted" label)
- **AND** neither shows a spinner or running pulse

### Requirement: The conversation-list running indicator SHALL agree with the composer's Interrupt control

The daemon conversation-list row's live status indicator (running / interrupted / error / idle) SHALL be derived from the SAME set of executions that the conversation's composer resolves for its Interrupt control — i.e. the origin-connection slice PREFERRED, with a fallback to every other connection slice when the origin slice has no execution matching this conversation. The match SHALL be strictly by this conversation's own idea anchor (`directIdeaUuid`, or the `::`-prefix heal for a legacy residual session) or its `daemon_session:<sessionId>` id, so a cross-connection match still belongs to this conversation only and SHALL NOT borrow another conversation's execution. As a result, the list row's indicator and the composer's Interrupt control SHALL never disagree: whenever the composer can offer Interrupt for a running turn, the list row SHALL show the running indicator, including after a `cwd`/agent switch or a session re-point that moved the running turn to a connection other than the conversation's origin.

#### Scenario: Running turn on the origin connection lights the row

- **GIVEN** an open agent's conversation whose running `DaemonExecution` is on the conversation's own origin connection
- **WHEN** the conversation list renders that row
- **THEN** the row's status indicator MUST read `running`

#### Scenario: Running turn on a non-origin connection still lights the row

- **GIVEN** a conversation whose origin-connection slice has NO matching execution but whose idea's running `DaemonExecution` lives on a DIFFERENT connection of the agent (after a cwd/agent switch or a session re-point)
- **WHEN** the conversation list renders that row
- **THEN** the row's status indicator MUST read `running` (agreeing with the composer's Interrupt control), NOT idle

#### Scenario: The row never borrows an unrelated conversation's run

- **GIVEN** another conversation's running `DaemonExecution` on a different connection, with no execution matching THIS conversation on any connection
- **WHEN** the conversation list renders THIS conversation's row
- **THEN** the row's status indicator MUST read idle (null) — the unrelated run MUST NOT be borrowed

#### Scenario: A user-interrupt on the fallback connection is reflected

- **GIVEN** a conversation whose origin slice has no match but whose matching execution on another connection is `interrupted` with reason `user`
- **WHEN** the conversation list renders that row
- **THEN** the row's status indicator MUST read `interrupted` (resumable); a crash-interrupt MUST read `error`

### Requirement: The daemon transcript header SHALL omit redundant lifecycle metadata

The Agent Daemon transcript header SHALL NOT render an “Active” lifecycle badge for an active conversation. It SHALL retain an explicit “Ended” badge for an ended conversation and SHALL preserve the independent running indicator and live elapsed runtime whenever the current turn is running.

The expanded connection-details disclosure SHALL NOT render the connection process start time or its relative “Started” value. It SHALL retain connection identity, online uptime, host, and all existing actions, and the retained fields SHALL reflow without an empty placeholder.

These presentation rules SHALL apply to every Agent Daemon transcript regardless of whether the session is idea-anchored or ad-hoc. They SHALL NOT remove `startedAt` from the connection data contract or change other connection-observability surfaces.

#### Scenario: Active conversation omits the lifecycle badge

- **WHEN** an active Agent Daemon conversation transcript renders
- **THEN** the header MUST NOT show the “Active” lifecycle badge
- **AND** the running indicator and elapsed runtime MUST still appear when the current turn is running

#### Scenario: Ended conversation retains terminal status

- **WHEN** an ended Agent Daemon conversation transcript renders
- **THEN** the header MUST show the existing “Ended” badge

#### Scenario: Connection disclosure omits relative start time

- **WHEN** the user expands connection details for a connection with a non-null `startedAt`
- **THEN** the disclosure MUST NOT show a “Started” field or relative process-start value
- **AND** connection identity, uptime when online, and host MUST remain visible without an empty reserved row

#### Scenario: Presentation scope does not alter the connection contract

- **WHEN** this header simplification is implemented
- **THEN** the connection API and frontend connection type MUST retain `startedAt`
- **AND** connection views outside the Agent Daemon transcript MUST remain unchanged
