// src/services/daemon-instruction.service.ts
// UI → daemon instruction injection — the SEND side (子2 — daemon-instruction-injection).
//
// This module is the thin, owner-scoped send surface that turns a human-typed free-text
// instruction into a `human_instruction` TURN on a `DaemonSession`. It COMPOSES the 子1
// DaemonSession foundation (PR #332) — it never re-models sessions, turns, the turn
// chokepoint, or the origin-online gate:
//   - `resolveOrCreateSession` / `assertContinuable` / `getVisibleSessions` /
//     `getSessionTurns` / `SessionReadOnlyError` / `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` live in
//     `daemon-session.service` (子1) and are imported here, not duplicated.
//   - The actual TURN is created at the SINGLE notification chokepoint
//     (`notification.service.create` → `maybeCreateTurnForWakeNotification`), so a
//     human instruction and an autonomous wake are handled symmetrically — exactly the
//     "every wake is a turn" model 子1 established. This service only feeds that
//     chokepoint a `human_instruction` notification and then reads back the turn it
//     created.
//   - Connection ownership / liveness reuses `connectionBelongsToAgent` +
//     `isConnectionLive` from `daemon-execution.service`.
//
// Origin-only live delivery (子2 keystone — task f6ad4e11): AFTER the chokepoint persists
// the `pending` turn, this module emits a `deliver_turn` control ping on the session's
// ORIGIN connection's per-connection channel (`control:{originConnectionUuid}`) so the
// live wake reaches ONLY that one daemon — never the agent-wide notification fan-out that
// would also wake a non-origin daemon (which lacks the cwd-bound transcript and would spawn
// a divergent session). The ping carries ONLY `targetConnectionUuid`: no instruction text,
// no entity — the daemon's connection-scoped pending-turns sweep reads the text from the
// persisted turn. The caller already proved ownership (the visibility/online gates above),
// so the ping is dispatched DIRECTLY via the control service rather than re-HTTP. It is
// fire-and-forget and NON-fatal: the turn is already persisted (the durability net is the
// daemon's reconnect-backfill, which re-derives the turn from the turn table), so a failed
// ping must NOT fail the send — but it is logged visibly (no silent errors). No
// `targetConnectionUuid` column is added to `Notification`; no new permission bit is
// introduced.

/**
 * Conversational-idea dispatch: PRE-CREATE the Idea and its root daemon session, then
 * send the first `human_instruction` turn — in ONE transaction (add-conversational-
 * idea-root-session). The pivotal property: the session is born IDEA-ANCHORED
 * (`sessionId = directIdeaUuid = ideaUuid`), so every subsequent idea-anchored wake
 * (elaboration answers, Verify Elaborate, proposal approval, task dispatch) resolves to
 * THIS session via the existing `sessionId === directIdeaUuid` convention — zero
 * wake-chokepoint changes, no write-once relaxation.
 *
 * Order (each gate before any mutation):
 *  1. Ownership + connection fences — `callerOwnsAgent` + `connectionBelongsToAgent`
 *     collapse to ONE `ConnectionNotVisibleError` (route → 404 non-disclosure);
 *     `isConnectionLive` → `ConnectionOfflineError` (route → 409). Same posture as
 *     `createAdHocSessionWithInstruction`.
 *  2. Project visibility (company-scoped; also supplies the template's project name) →
 *     `ProjectNotVisibleError` (route → 404).
 *  3. The connection's durable `agentInstanceUuid` must resolve — the idea's instance
 *     pin must point at a real place → `ConnectionInstanceMissingError` (route → 409).
 *  4. SERVER generates the ideaUuid, composes the instruction around it, and validates
 *     the COMPOSED text (`validateInstructionText`) → `InstructionTextError` (route →
 *     400). Generating the uuid before the transaction is what lets the instruction
 *     embed it while keeping all writes atomic.
 *  5. ONE `prisma.$transaction`: create the Idea (createdBy = caller, placeholder
 *     title, VERBATIM description as content, `agent_instance` assignee, status
 *     `elaborating` — assignment-equals-claim), the DaemonSession (sessionId =
 *     directIdeaUuid = ideaUuid, origin = the chosen connection, write-once written
 *     once correctly), and the first `human_instruction` turn (seq 1, promptText =
 *     the composed instruction — canonical copy). All-or-nothing: a mid-transaction
 *     failure persists nothing (no orphan idea).
 *
 *     The turn is written DIRECTLY here, not through the notification chokepoint:
 *     `createReturningTurn` runs on the global prisma client and could neither see the
 *     uncommitted idea/session nor join the transaction — and its directed-wake path
 *     would emit a second `deliver_turn` ping (the proposal-review cautions). The
 *     dispatch itself IS the wake, so no notification row is needed; the turn table is
 *     the daemon's canonical backfill source, which this write lands in atomically.
 *  6. After commit (in order): publish the `turn_created` transcript SSE trigger (the
 *     chokepoint would have done this; the viewer must see the first turn live), emit
 *     the idea `created` change event (SSE-driven idea lists update), and fire the
 *     origin-only `deliver_turn` ping with the precise turnUuid (fire-and-forget +
 *     non-fatal — the persisted turn + reconnect-backfill are the durability net).
 *
 *     Deliberately NO "assigned" Activity is recorded: that activity fans out an
 *     `idea_claimed` notification whose wake would create a SECOND turn on this very
 *     session. The dispatch is the wake — one turn, one ping.
 *
 * Returns `{ idea, session, turn }`. Throws the typed errors above (mapped by the
 * route). A query/write failure propagates (no silent swallow).
