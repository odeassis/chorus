// src/services/daemon-session.service.ts
// Daemon Session Service — the DURABLE conversation layer for a daemon's Claude
// session (子1 — daemon-session-conversation). Where `daemon-execution.service`
// models the *live* running/queued snapshot a connection reports (rows flip to
// `ended` when absent from the next snapshot), THIS module models a persistent
// conversation that OUTLIVES that: a `DaemonSession` keyed `(agentUuid, sessionId)`
// holds an ordered list of `DaemonSessionTurn` rows, one per wake — autonomous
// (task_assigned / mentioned / elaboration / resume) or human (human_instruction).
// Identity and history survive the holding connection going offline and the daemon
// restarting; a session is NEVER deleted merely because its connection dropped.
//
// This is the SINGLE chokepoint for two mutations — turn creation and turn status
// transitions — so it OWNS publishing the live-update SSE triggers (see "SSE
// contract" below). The route layer and the notification chokepoint call into here;
// no turn/session business logic lives in routes (service-layer convention).
//
// It reuses, never re-models:
//   - `lineage.service.resolveRootIdea` for `directIdeaUuid` resolution, and
//   - the connection registry's exported `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` for the single
//     offline/staleness verdict used by `assertContinuable` (no second constant).
//
// Continuation is PINNED to the session's `originConnectionUuid`: a turn is only
// ever continued on the cwd/machine that holds the on-disk `claude --resume`
// transcript. An offline origin makes the session read-only (history still
// visible); it is NEVER re-routed to another connection of the same agent, because
// a resume against a different working directory would `No conversation found`.

 * caller (the notification chokepoint), which is also where lineage is resolved.
 *
 * Upsert semantics on the `@@unique([agentUuid, sessionId])`:
 *  - CREATE stamps `originConnectionUuid` (the connection/cwd that owns the on-disk
 *    transcript) and `directIdeaUuid` (nullable) ONCE, at creation. Both are FIXED
 *    thereafter: a later wake on the same `(agent, session)` reuses the existing row
 *    and does NOT move the origin connection (continuation is cwd-bound) nor re-derive
 *    the direct idea.
 *  - UPDATE (the row already exists) re-affirms only `companyUuid` from the
 *    authenticated context (multi-tenancy: never trusted from the request body). It
 *    deliberately does NOT touch `originConnectionUuid` / `directIdeaUuid` — those are
 *    write-once. `lastTurnAt` is bumped by `createPendingTurn` (the turn write), not
 *    here, so a resolve without a turn does not falsely advance the conversation clock.
 *
 * `directIdeaUuid` may be passed pre-resolved by the caller; when omitted (or null) and
 * the session is being created, this still records null (ad-hoc). The companyUuid is
 * stamped on the row. A query failure propagates (a write that does NOT swallow — the
 * session must exist before a turn is appended to it).

 * Advance the most-recent turn of the agent's `(agentUuid, sessionId)` session to

 * `appendTranscriptMessages`' sessionId path (own session → its highest-`seq` turn);
 * a session that does not resolve for this agent, or that has no turn yet, yields
 * `not_found` (non-disclosure). The transition itself goes through `advanceTurn`, so
 * an illegal transition surfaces as `invalid_transition` (the route maps it to a 409)
 * rather than silently succeeding.
 *
 * When `entityType`/`entityUuid` are supplied AND the live `DaemonExecution` row for
 * `(companyUuid, connectionUuid, entity)` resolves, its uuid is stamped onto the turn
 * as the weak `executionUuid` link — recorded WITHOUT touching execution-state
 * reconcile semantics. `startedAt` defaults to the transition time on the `running`
 * edge and `endedAt` on either terminal edge (`ended`/`interrupted`) — the daemon's
 * spawn/exit/stop moment — unless the caller passes explicit timestamps.
 * `interruptedReason` is passed through to `advanceTurn` (persisted only on the
 * → interrupted edge). A query/write failure propagates (no swallow): a lost
 * transition would strand a turn's lifecycle.
