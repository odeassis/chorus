// src/services/notification-turn.ts
// Wake-notification → DaemonSessionTurn bridge (子1 — daemon-session-conversation).
//
// `notification.service` create/createBatch is the SINGLE chokepoint where every
// wake-triggering Notification row is born — symmetric for autonomous wakes
// (task dispatch / @mention / elaboration / PM-flow transitions) and the human-typed
// instruction (子2). This module is the bridge that, for such a notification destined
// for a DAEMON agent, records the corresponding `DaemonSessionTurn` so the daemon's
// Claude conversation gains one turn per wake.
//
// It NEVER reimplements session/turn logic — it composes the daemon-session service
// (`resolveOrCreateSession` + `createPendingTurn` + `resolveDirectIdeaUuid`) and the
// connection registry (`listConnectionsForAgent`, to pin the cwd-bound origin).
//
// ONLINE-ONLY WAKE: only an ONLINE connection is wakeable. When the agent has NO online
// connection at all, no turn is created — the already-created Notification stands as the
// plain record (a fully-offline target is a notification-only event; there is NO durable
// queue / backfill of pending turns).
//
// DIRECTED LIVE DELIVERY (fix-pinned-wake-directed-delivery, T1): a PINNED autonomous wake
// (`mentioned` with a markup pin, or an assignment wake whose Task / root Idea is pinned to
// an `agent_instance`) and the idea-anchored `elaboration_verified` wake are DIRECTED so
// only the resolved instance wakes — mirroring the `human_instruction` keystone (子2). When
// such a wake resolves to an ONLINE target connection, the turn is created against THAT
// connection's session and a `deliver_turn` control ping is emitted on its
// `control:{connectionUuid}` channel (fire-and-forget + non-fatal; the persisted turn +
// reconnect backfill are the durability net). The resolved target is also surfaced
// TRANSPORT-ONLY to the daemon (see `WakeTurnResult.targetConnectionUuid`) so non-target
// daemons suppress their broadcast copy.
//
// HARD PINS — the UNIFIED offline policy (owner choice B, pin-cwd-before-wake): EVERY pin
// is HARD. Whether the pin came from a human-typed mention `(host, cwd)` OR from an
// assignment (the Task's own `agent_instance` override, or the inherited root-Idea
// instance), an offline pin is NOTIFY-ONLY, NO WAKE — no turn, no ping, no target; the
// already-created Notification stands as the plain record (recovered on reconnect by the
// pending-turn backfill for recoverable triggers). This is a deliberate REVERSAL of #354's
// "offline pin → online-first": silently re-routing a pinned wake to a cwd the owner did
// NOT choose is the user-visible defect this preserves the fix for. There is NO SOFT
// assignment pin any more — an assignment pin NEVER degrades to the agent's online-first
// connection. (The `PinnedTarget.soft` field is RETAINED at always-`false` for a minimal
// diff — see `PinnedTarget.soft` — so the `soft:true` branch of `selectOriginConnection`
// is now unreachable dead code kept only for the field's shape; a follow-up may drop it.)
// An UN-PINNED wake is unaffected and still goes broadcast → online-first.
//
// FAILURE ISOLATION (repo "no silent errors" + the wake notification must always
// survive): turn creation runs AFTER the notification row already exists, and any
// throw is logged VISIBLY (never swallowed) but is NOT propagated — a lost turn must
// never abort or block the notification that was already created. The caller invokes
// this fire-and-forget; it returns the created turn (for tests / callers that want it)
// or null when no turn was created (recipient is a human, the agent has no online
// daemon, the action is not wake-triggering, or creation failed and was logged).

// ===== Action → trigger mapping =====
//
// The `Notification.action` values that imply the daemon should ACT are the daemon's
// wake set (`cli/prompts.mjs` WAKE_ACTIONS) intersected with what actually flows
// through `notification.service` (a persisted Notification row). Verified against the
// code, NOT memory:
//   - `notification-listener.ts` resolveNotificationType emits the prefixed action
//     forms: task_assigned, task_verified, task_reopened, idea_claimed,
//     proposal_approved, proposal_rejected, elaboration_requested,
//     elaboration_answered (plus non-wake noise: task_status_changed,
//     task_submitted_for_verify, comment_added, report_created).
//   - `mention.service.ts` creates `action: "mentioned"` directly (bypasses the
//     listener), which IS a wake action.
//   - `resource_resumed` is a SYNTHETIC control-channel dispatch (子3) — it is NEVER
//     a persisted Notification, so it cannot reach this chokepoint and is therefore
//     deliberately absent here.
//   - `human_instruction` is the UI-sent instruction (子2): the chokepoint receives a
//     Notification with that action and the free-text body in `instructionText`.
//
// The `DaemonSessionTurn.trigger` enum is the NARROW 6-value taxonomy
// (task_assigned | mentioned | elaboration | elaboration_verified | resume |
// human_instruction). This table collapses each wake action into its canonical
// trigger category so every wake-triggering notification yields exactly one turn:
//   - @mention                                   → mentioned
//   - elaboration request / answer               → elaboration
//   - elaboration verified (human-verify wake)   → elaboration_verified (distinct from
//                                                  the "answer the questions" elaboration
//                                                  trigger — this one means "write the
//                                                  proposal")
//   - human-typed instruction                    → human_instruction
//   - every other autonomous dispatch (task
//     assignment, task reopen/verify unblock,
//     idea claim, proposal approve/reject)       → task_assigned (the autonomous
//                                                  task-dispatch trigger)
//

 *       - `none`         — agent fully offline → NO turn (the notification stands).

 *     stage-advance trigger, resolve the AGENT OWNER's fixed project cwd and, when set,
 *     re-select against it as a HARD pin — replacing the arbitrary "first cwd". Offline
 *     pinned cwd → `offline_pin` (notify-only), never re-routed.
 *  5. Derive the session id: the entity's `directIdeaUuid` via lineage when the entityType
 *     is lineage-walkable, else the entity uuid (ad-hoc). For a CROSS-CWD directed mention
 *     (the resolved target differs from the idea's existing session origin), the resolved
 *     INSTANCE participates in the session business key so each `(host, cwd)` keeps its own
 *     cwd-bound transcript — NEVER re-pointing the existing session's origin (which would
 *     `No conversation found` on `--resume`).
 *  6. `resolveOrCreateSession` (origin + directIdeaUuid write-once on create) then
 *     `createPendingTurn` with the mapped trigger. For `human_instruction`, the turn's
 *     `promptText` is the instruction body (canonical); every other trigger has a null
 *     promptText (the daemon rebuilds the autonomous prompt from notification context).
 *  7. DIRECTED wake only: emit a `deliver_turn` control ping on the target connection's
 *     `control:{connectionUuid}` channel carrying the precise `turnUuid` (reuses the
 *     `human_instruction` keystone `deliverTurnPing`). Fire-and-forget + non-fatal (the
 *     persisted turn + reconnect backfill are the durability net). Surface the target.
 *
 * FAILURE ISOLATION: any throw from steps 3-7 is caught, logged VISIBLY, and swallowed —
 * a turn-creation/ping failure MUST NOT abort or block the already-created notification.
