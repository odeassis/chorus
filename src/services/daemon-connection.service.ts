// All functions are companyUuid-scoped. The two error-handling regimes are
// deliberately different:
//   - WRITE functions (registerConnection / markDisconnected / touchConnection)
//     swallow-and-log on failure: a registry write must NEVER throw to the
//     caller, so a failing DB write can never block or break SSE stream setup /
//     event delivery.
//   - READ functions (listConnectionsForOwner / listConnectionsForAgent) do NOT
//     swallow: a query failure propagates so the route surfaces a 500. An empty
//     list must mean genuinely zero rows, not a hidden error.

/**
 * Register (upsert) a daemon connection as `online`.
 *
 * Returns a `ConnectionHandle` (`{ uuid, connectedAt }`) on success, or `null`
 * when:
 *  - the clientType is not a recognized daemon type (the caller then skips the
 *    rest of the lifecycle — no touch / no markDisconnected), or
 *  - the persistence write fails (swallowed + logged).
 *
 * Idempotent per logical daemon: keyed on (agentUuid, clientType, host, cwd) —
 * the composite unique key T1 widened with `cwd`. A reconnect refreshes the
 * existing row (status→online, connectedAt/lastSeenAt refreshed, disconnectedAt
 * cleared) rather than inserting a new one. `host` defaults to "" so the key is
 * deterministic even for a host-less self-report.
 *
 * cwd carries the working directory this connection serves, which fixes the
 * overwrite bug: the *same* agent on the *same* host driving two *different*
 * cwds now lands two independent rows (each its own presence) instead of one
 * overwriting the other. "Unknown cwd" is represented as SQL `NULL` (NOT the
 * empty string) — consistent with the nullable `cwd` column and the rows
 * backfilled to NULL at migration time. (This supersedes T1's compile-only
 * `cwd=""` shim, which existed only to preserve deterministic dedup until this
 * task wired the real self-report; the ""-vs-NULL asymmetry is resolved here in
 * favor of NULL.)
 *
 * Two write paths, because Postgres + Prisma treat a NULL cwd specially:
 *  - cwd PRESENT (a current daemon) → a single `upsert` on the compound unique
 *    key. Clean idempotent reconnect.
 *  - cwd NULL (an OLD daemon that does not self-report cwd — HARD-1) → we CANNOT
 *    use the compound-key upsert: Postgres treats each NULL as distinct in a
 *    UNIQUE index (so two `(agent,clientType,host,NULL)` rows never collide) AND
 *    Prisma types the compound-key `where` field as non-null (so NULL cannot be
 *    targeted there at all). Both verified empirically by T1 on Postgres 16. A
 *    naive cwd=null upsert would therefore ACCUMULATE a fresh row on every
 *    reconnect. So we implement the tech design's compatibility path: find the
 *    existing `(agentUuid, clientType, host, cwd:null)` row via `findFirst` and
 *    `update` it by uuid; only `create` when none exists. This keeps an old
 *    daemon on a single stable null row across reconnects — no error, no
 *    rejection, behavior identical to the pre-cwd world. New and old daemons
 *    coexist under the same agent without interfering (the new daemon owns its
 *    cwd row; the old daemon owns its null row).
 *
 * The returned `connectedAt` is the fencing token for the lifecycle calls: it is
 * stamped fresh on every (re)registration, so a later reconnect's `connectedAt`
 * differs from an earlier generation's. `touchConnection` / `markDisconnected`
 * gate on it, so an older connection's late `abort` or lingering heartbeat
 * cannot flip the newer generation's row (the "stale-abort-resurrects-offline"
 * race).
 */
/**
 * Upsert the durable `AgentInstance` for `(companyUuid, agentUuid, host, cwd)` and
 * return its uuid. This is the stable `(agent, host, cwd)` identity that outlives
 * the churning `DaemonConnection.uuid` (which is recreated on every reconnect via
 * its own composite `@@unique`). Called from `registerConnection` so the very same
 * handshake that registers a connection also materializes (or reuses) the instance
 * it serves, then links the connection to it.
 *
 * Idempotent per identity tuple: a repeat report for an existing `(agent,host,cwd)`
 * reuses the row (no duplicate); the returned uuid is therefore stable across
 * reconnects even though the connection uuid is not.
 *
 * Same two write paths as the connection upsert, and for the same reason — Postgres
 * treats a NULL `cwd` as distinct in the `@@unique([companyUuid,agentUuid,host,cwd])`
 * index, and Prisma types the compound-key `where` field as non-null:
 *  - cwd PRESENT → a single compound-key `upsert` (clean idempotent reuse). The
 *    `update` is a no-op data-wise (the identity tuple cannot change), but it bumps
 *    `updatedAt` and, crucially, returns the existing row's uuid.
 *  - cwd NULL → `findFirst` the existing `(…, cwd:null)` row and reuse its uuid;
 *    only `create` when none exists — mirroring the connection null-cwd branch so an
 *    old daemon keeps a single stable instance row across reconnects (no pileup).
 *
 * Returns null on failure; the caller treats a null instance as "could not link"
 * and still registers the connection (the link is additive — a missing link must
