// src/app/api/daemon/pending-turns/route.ts
// Daemon reconnect-backfill read of UNSTARTED turns (子1 — daemon-session-conversation).
//
// GET — after the daemon's SSE stream reconnects, it re-derives the turns that arrived
// during the gap from the TURN TABLE (the canonical source), NOT from notifications —
// so a lost delivery ping never loses an instruction. This returns every `pending`
// (unstarted) turn of the sessions whose origin is the daemon's own connection, for the
// authenticated agent within its company.
//
// Auth mirrors the execution-state GET precedent: any valid auth context (notably an
// agent API key) is accepted, there is NO MCP tool and NO new permission bit, and the
// readable set is scoped to the caller's OWN sessions by the service. The connectionUuid
// must belong to the authenticated agent; a connection the agent does not own (or that
// does not exist) yields 404 — never a 403 that would confirm another agent's connection
// exists.
