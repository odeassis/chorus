// src/mcp/tools/permission-map.ts
//
// Coverage contract for permission-gated MCP tools.
//
// This map is the *source of truth for tests* (src/mcp/__tests__/server.test.ts):
// it lets the suite assert that every tool gated via `registerPermissionedTool`
// is registered under the expected Permission, and catches drift when someone
// adds a new tool without a gate. Production tool registration uses
// `registerPermissionedTool` with its Permission inlined at the call site — the
// map is intentionally not consulted at runtime so the permission for each tool
// stays visible next to the handler.
//
// Most public-namespaced tools in public.ts (read-only discovery, comments,
// session, notifications) are NOT gated and are intentionally absent from this
// map. The exception is `chorus_create_report`, which is public-namespaced
// (no `pm_` prefix per add-idea-completion-report Tech Design §"MCP tool
// contract") but IS gated on `document:write` — it appears here because it
// goes through `registerPermissionedTool`. Session tools (session.ts) remain
// ungated. See Tech Design §5.3.
