// Reviewer-definition parity guard.
//
// The three Chorus reviewers (proposal / task / aggregate-code) are duplicated
// across SEVEN distribution surfaces — 21 files in total — and they are NOT
// verbatim copies of one another: they range 117-226 lines, use three different
// heading idioms (`=== X ===`, `## Title case`, `## Title Case` + `---`), and
// the Kiro surface embeds its whole prompt inside one JSON string field. There
// is no shared include mechanism, so "add a reviewer rule" literally means
// "write it 21 times, adapted to each file's voice".
//
// That has already gone wrong: an earlier change landed its turn-budget wording
// in only 3 of the 6 non-Claude-Code surfaces. This test pins the rules added by
// the trackable-reviewer-findings change so the next edit cannot land on a
// subset of surfaces unnoticed.
//
// Why the path list is hardcoded rather than globbed: a glob would silently
// cover an eighth surface the moment someone added its directory, which is
// exactly the failure we want to be loud about — a new surface must be added
// here deliberately. A glob would also sweep in the stale copies under
// `.next/standalone/`, `packages/chorus-cdk/cdk.out/` and `.claude/worktrees/`,
// which are build artifacts and would keep this test permanently red.
//
// Why the character-cap regex is written generically (`\d+`, optional `~`, and
// several phrasings) rather than pinning 800/1000: the point is not to delete
// two specific numbers, it is that a total-output budget must never come back.
// Every reviewer's output format demands full command/output/evidence for a
// BLOCKER, so any byte budget is paid out of that evidence. Noise is bounded by
// relevance (at most 5 newly-raised NOTEs), not by bytes.
